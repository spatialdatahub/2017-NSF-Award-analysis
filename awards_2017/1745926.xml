<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funds to support student travel to the European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming (ECOOP 2018) and the ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2018), which will take place in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, July 16-23, 2018. ECOOP is a major conference for programming language and software engineering research. This year, as it happens, ECOOP will be co-located with another major conference, ISSTA, which is the top conference in software testing and analysis. The combined event is a very worthwhile event for students to attend. The funds requested from NSF will help support the large number of students that are expected to attend ECOOP/ISSTA 2018. The requested funding would be used only to support the conference attendance of students who are (i) US citizens or US permanent residents and/or (ii) enrolled in undergraduate or graduate programs at accredited US universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds support advancing the field through technical discussions and presentations, and the building of a workforce that pursues careers in research for programming languages and software engineering areas.</AbstractNarration>
