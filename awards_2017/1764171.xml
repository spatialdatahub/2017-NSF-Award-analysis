<AbstractNarration>This project is focused on investigating the potential impacts of future volcanic eruptions on stratospheric ozone.  Stratospheric ozone shields the Earth from harmful ultra-violet radiation and hence it is important to understand how volcanic eruptions might impact stratospheric chemistry leading to changes in the protective ozone layer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objectives of this proposal are threefold: (1) characterize column ozone sensitivity to contemporary and future explosive volcanic eruptions as a function of volcanic latitude and season; (2) determine ozone column sensitivity to the direct stratospheric co-injection of inorganic chlorine, bromine, and iodine along with sulfur dioxide from volcanic eruption; and (3) quantify future bromine and iodine alpha factors (the relative ozone-destroying activity of bromine and iodine relative to chlorine) in a variety of greenhouse gas emission scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effort will employ the SOlar Climate Ozone Links model with aerosol microphysics (SOCOL-AER) for the majority of the scenarios.  The chemical transport model AER-2D will also be used to quantify the sensitivity of stratospheric ozone for elements of the project where dynamics play a less significant role.  A postdoctoral fellow will perform many of the experiments and the work will provide opportunities for the development of research skills by undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
