<AbstractNarration>This project will develop and provide publicly available computer codes and documentation intended to assist in solving problems in quantum dynamics using high-level programming languages and high-performance computers (HPC).  These resources will enable researchers to more effectively utilize the nation's investment in HPC, advancing the pace of scientific discovery and innovation. Of particular interest are applications of quantum dynamics to both ultracold atoms and to nuclear astrophysics. For example, a theory of quantum hydrodynamics is needed to properly describe recent experiments with confined ultracold gases and could also lay the foundation for a resolution of the 40-year old mystery of pulsar glitches, sudden increases in the spinning of neutron stars even though they continually lose angular momentum. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be trained with the analytical and high-performance computational skills to succeed in their future pursuits in academia, at national laboratories, or in industry.  A superfluid explorer will be developed, enabling people to experience the fascinating properties of our quantum universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This theoretical work will be applied to three types of cold-atom experiments at Washington State University (WSU) and the University of Washington (UW).  The first are Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with various interactions such as induced spin-orbit coupling.  Here, a variety of exotic phenomena will be studied, including negative-mass hydrodynamics, and soliton dynamics.  The theoretical approach will be refined as required to incorporate the effects of finite temperature and dissipation.  The second class of applications is to experiments with coupled superfluids which explore the physics of entrainment and other superfluid interactions.  Finally, the project will explore whether and how experiments with fermionic superfluids can model the proton and neutron superfluids in neutron stars.  Understanding these quantum phenomena will directly advance the field of cold atoms, unlocking potential applications in quantum technology, such as improved sensing and quantum computing.  The underlying theory will also advance other fields, including condensed matter, non-linear optics, nuclear theory, and nuclear astrophysics.</AbstractNarration>
