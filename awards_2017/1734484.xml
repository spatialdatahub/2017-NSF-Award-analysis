<AbstractNarration>The Solar System objects that formed farthest away from the Sun and remained in these locations are also the objects least changed over the long period of time since they were formed.  They likely still keep clues to the conditions at the time of the formation of the Solar System.  These conditions could also be present in other planetary systems.  These astronomers will observe about 50 of these objects over the life of the study to learn about the characteristics of the objects, including their shape, the rate they spin, their coloring, and whether two objects formed close enough to touch each other.  Telescopes in Arizona and Chile will be used in the study.  This project serves the national interest as it increases our scientific knowledge about the most pristine objects in the Solar System.  The Principal Investigator's home institution, Lowell Observatory, will include the results in their public outreach programs, which reach well over 100,000 people per year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will conduct a comprehensive observational study of the dynamically Cold Classical (CC) trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) to understand their formation, evolution, composition, and rotational properties.  They will build an extensive data set of visible images for astrometry, lightcurve, color, and binary object study.  These data will be used as tracers of the formation and evolution of this pristine population.  They will regularly use the 4.3-m Discovery Channel Telescope and the 6.5-m Magellan Telescope and plan to include several NOAO facilities in case of interesting targets.  Cold Classical objects with a visual magnitude up to 23.5 - 24 mag in all size ranges will be targeted, with priority given to objects that are potentially contact binaries.  The investigators plan to characterize 15 - 20 CCs per year, resulting in a sample of about 50 objects at the end of the project.  By studying these most pristine objects in the Solar System, the investigators will determine primordial constraints crucially needed to understand the entire TNO population, and, by extension, the formation and evolution of both our own Solar System and other planetary systems.  Results from the research will be incorporated into Lowell Observatory outreach programs including the visitor center which receives about 100,000 visitors every year, as well as the "Meet An Astronomer" and the "Navajo-Hopi outreach" programs.</AbstractNarration>
