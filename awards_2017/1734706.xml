<AbstractNarration>The Computing Community Consortium (CCC) is established through a Cooperative Agreement between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Computing Research Association (CRA). Since its inception, the purpose of the CCC has been to catalyze the development of bold, far-reaching visions for computing research, and to facilitate the communication of those research visions to stakeholders both within and beyond the computing research ecosystem.  The CCC fosters proactive engagement with both computing and non-computing research stakeholders -- agencies, industry, professional societies, consortia, and philanthropic stakeholders -- to ensure that it continues to expand its network and impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CCC provides the continuity and capacity to bring together stakeholders that depend on computing innovation as part of increasingly diverse and multi-disciplinary national and societal needs. The CCC plays a vital and effective role in catalyzing the computing research community to articulate far reaching and strategic research visions that will continue to shape the field for decades to come. The majority of CCC visioning activities and white papers bring together multidisciplinary expertise and needs that combine to create important disciplinary and interdisciplinary challenges for the computing field. The results of these activities are disseminated back to the community to ensure continued revitalization and advancement of new areas and topics for future computing research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
