<AbstractNarration>This project builds on the University of Alaska Fisheries, Seafood, and Maritime Initiative to develop a strong and sustainable workforce particularly in Alaska's coastal communities. A Gap Analysis performed for the Initiative identified the following as needs for Alaskan fisheries industries: 1) grow career awareness; 2) develop career pathways; 3) improve access to employment; 4) educate Alaskans for fisheries, seafood, and maritime employment; and 5) improve industry engagement and accountability. This project will develop a semester intensive program to increase the labor pool available for aquaculture facilities, while supporting student employment opportunities following a short educational intervention. This model of offering short, intensive programs that support gains in knowledge and relevant skills may apply to other aspects of the Fisheries Technology program, such as fisheries management, as well as other university programs that educate technicians. All seven of the aquaculture associations in Alaska, accounting for 25 hatcheries, have offered space, time, and mentorship to support this proposal. This inclusive collaboration for technician training in aquaculture is unprecedented in Alaska.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Alaska Southeast Fisheries Technology program will offer a hands-on, semester-intensive program for entry level aquaculture/hatchery technicians. During this semester-long program, students will take 12 industry endorsed university credits over a four-month period that will give them the knowledge and skills needed to start work in the fisheries industry. This semester-intensive program was designed in response to a needs assessment completed by members from 16 hatchery organizations, which defined the need for hands-on, short-duration education programs in basic aquaculture education. This program will include basic aquaculture techniques used in Alaska salmon hatcheries, hatchery design and function, species biology, production processes, skiff operation, and outboard engine troubleshooting. The program will be based out of Sitka, Alaska, which is the headquarters of a regional Aquaculture Association, three unique hatcheries, and the University of Alaska Sitka campus. Students will complete an internship during the semester, to reinforce what they have learned, and will visit at least two other facilities around the state, thus exposing them to a variety of operations and explore life at remote sites. Graduates from this program will have a solid knowledge base and skill set that many salmon enhancement sectors need for entry-level technicians and will gain the experience working alongside professionals in the industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
