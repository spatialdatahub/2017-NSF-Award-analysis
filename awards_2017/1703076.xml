<AbstractNarration>This project aims to understand the causes of persistent and severe drought in the continental United States (US) at particular periods in the past using climate model simulations and paleo records. Warming of the subtropical North Atlantic and local dust feedbacks have been shown to cause drought conditions in North America. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers hypothesize that during the Early to Mid-Holocene and in the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), these effects combined to create severe droughts that are far larger than observed during the modern historical period.  In the Early Holocene, North American proglacial lakes began to drain, leading to a pulse of freshwater into the North Atlantic around 8.2 ka. Enhanced dust emissions from the desiccated glacial lake beds are found in proxy records in the northcentral US, but the role of enhanced North American dust deposition on climate change has not been assessed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will explore the role of sea surface temperature perturbations and local and remote dust-climate feedbacks on extreme Holocene paleo-droughts in North America as well as the impact of drought and dust on ice sheet extent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will support an early career female scientist to develop skills in model design and development, as well as enhance her participation in the NCAR paleoclimate modeling group. The researchers will participate in the University of Miami SEEDS (Scientists and Engineers Expanding Diversity and Success) program, which has career workshops, networking, and distinguished lectureships, and the annual Women in Science Day that brings middle school girls to campus to meet with female scientists to learn about their research and potential career paths. In addition, the project will entrain undergraduate students as part of their undergraduate student thesis.</AbstractNarration>
