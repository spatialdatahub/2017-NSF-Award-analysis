<AbstractNarration>The Lowell Observatory Navajo-Hopi Astronomy Outreach Program is a science enrichment program for Navajo and Hopi elementary school (5th-8th grade) students and their teachers.  The program uses astronomy-Â­related activities in order to help teachers inspire students about science.  The high school graduation rate of children in the Navajo and Hopi Nations is well below state and national averages; this program aims to inspire Native children to stay in school and to pursue careers in science.  The investigators have taken the time to build relationships with the Native communities and to understand cultural differences that might hold children back from engaging in science.  For example, several Nations have taboos about looking directly at the Moon or at a solar eclipse.  The investigators build partnerships between astronomers and teachers in Native communities with each astronomer making multiple visits to a school to lead activities with the teachers and students.  The school groups then visit Lowell Observatory for tours and visit the telescopes for a night of observing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators plan to develop curriculum based on Project Based Learning and to explore the possibilities of expanding their program.   For example, Burt Medicine Bull, a Northern Cheyenne educator, is interested in collaborating with the group.  Trying their methods with a different group of students from the Northern Cheyenne Nation will help them determine how easy it will be to export their program.   Assessment and evaluation will be managed by an education professor at Northern Arizona University who is an expert at working with Native educational groups.</AbstractNarration>
