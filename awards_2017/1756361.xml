<AbstractNarration>Variability in the transport of heat, freshwater and mass in the North Atlantic has been linked to a number of societally relevant factors including sea level change, the melting of sea and glacial ice, and anthropogenic carbon storage in the deep ocean. However, the current understanding of the drivers of such changes is limited, making an investigation of overturning in the Sub-polar region a key ocean research priority. This field program explicitly addresses this gap. Furthermore, by engaging the larger international community studying the North Atlantic, Overturning in the Sub-polar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP) is playing a key role in catalyzing scientific progress by promoting international collaborations, synthesis, and the sharing of resources and by training future generations. Key to the latter is a network of early career scientists whose professional growth will continue to be facilitated through targeted activities that have been tested and improved during OSNAP's initial phase. Graduate students and post-docs will be trained in seagoing operations and in the processing and analysis of observational data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this field project, in conjunction with other measurements in the North Atlantic, is to establish determination of the linkage between intermediate and deep water formation and the overturning circulation--a connection that is present in climate models, but has yet to be observed. This project will also provide the first comprehensive view of spreading pathways for the deep waters in the Sub-polar basin. Starting in 2014, the US-led international project, Overturning in the Sub-polar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP), provides a continuous record of the full-water column, trans-basin fluxes of heat, mass and freshwater in the Sub-polar North Atlantic, in partnership with the UK, Netherlands, Canada, Germany and China. Data from the first 21 months of the full OSNAP observing system has been used to produce an initial time series of the meridional overturning, heat and freshwater fluxes for the Sub-polar basin. These preliminary results reveal a highly variable overturning in the basin, interior pathways for overflow waters, surprisingly energetic boundary current systems on timescales from days to months, and a strong overflow plume in the Iceland Basin. The additional two years of OSNAP observations will cover a time frame sufficient to make comparisons with other overturning time series and optimize the OSNAP measurement system--all necessary tasks prior to a request for longer term measurements. This component of OSNAP (OSNAP West) is for the western array across the Labrador Sea between Greenland and Canada in coordination with Germany and Canada. The sub-goal for OSNAP is to quantify the structure and transport of the West Greenland boundary current system and determine the nature of its variability and shelf-slope exchange. In addition, the overflow water pathways throughout the subpolar region and the mechanisms responsible for their variability will be studied by analyzing the subsurface float data collected since 2014 and the output of high-resolution ocean circulation models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
