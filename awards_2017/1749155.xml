<AbstractNarration>Title: Student Travel Support for Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop at POPL 2018&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Seventh Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) will take place on January 17 2018, as part of the flagship programming language conference, Principles of Programming Languages (POPL), which will be held in Los Angeles, California. This grant will support approximately 10 students to attend the PLMW event, in addition to the POPL conference. While there is other funding available (through ACM SIGPLAN PAC) for students who are presenting papers at POPL, this proposal is intended specifically to increase the numbers of students from underrepresented groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents. The broader significance and importance of the grant relate to the need to broaden participation, provide opportunities for students to receive mentoring from leading members of the programming languages community, and build the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in this important research arena.</AbstractNarration>
