<AbstractNarration>This project would investigate the marine chemistry of the compound acrylate. Acrylate is a mostly overlooked by-product of a very well-studied process through which a compound known as DMSP (dimethylsulfoniopropionate), a compound produced by phytoplankton, is converted to the gas dimethylsulfide (known as DMS). This process is an important part of understanding the marine cycling of sulfur, and DMS plays a role in cloud formation and climate. Thus, these aspects of the conversion of DMSP to DMS have received considerable attention. On the other hand, very little is known about acrylate concentrations, fluxes, or impacts in the oceans, even though it is produced during the conversion of DMSP to DMS.  Acrylate concentrations and fluxes should at times be substantial, especially in shallow-water coral reefs or during blooms of DMSP-rich phytoplankton that are common throughout the world's oceans and often harmful or toxic. It is likely that acrylate is a reactive form of marine organic matter that significantly impacts the carbon cycle and ecology of the upper ocean. This project will foster research and educational opportunities for undergraduates and one graduate student through several avenues including field work with international collaborators, attendance at national and local meetings, mentoring, preparing for and delivering college-level lectures, and presentations made to the general public at forums such as Syracuse's Milton J. Rubenstein Museum of Science. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, media communications, web-based data bases, and presentations at scientific meetings, public forums and in the classroom. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A three-year project is proposed to study the effect of sunlight on the formation and loss of acrylate in seawater, to model these processes in the water column, and to determine if photoproduction and photolysis are important pathways in the marine acrylate cycle in a shallow-water coral reef. Four objectives are planned to carry out this research: (1) synthesize radiocarbon-labeled DMSP as a source of radiocarbon-labeled acrylate for photolysis and uptake studies; (2) conduct laboratory experiments using a solar simulator to study the photolysis and photoproduction of acrylate in water and seawater under varying conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, oxygen concentration); (3) determine temperature and wavelength-dependent quantum yields for acrylate photolysis and acrylate photoproduction in seawater using a monochromatic irradiation system; and (4) conduct a field study at the Richard Gump Research Station to determine rates of photolysis, photoproduction and microbial consumption of acrylate in a shallow-water coral reef.</AbstractNarration>
