<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on combining solid mechanics experimentation and material visualization to enhance undergraduate solid mechanics education and assist students to develop appropriate mental models of abstract engineering concepts to enhance learning.  This effort employs multiple length scale material characterization and visualization for solid mechanics education, web-based education modules, and experiential learning.  A broad impact of this research is a contribution to the education of future professional engineers in fundamental solid mechanics and increase in the critical number of individuals who are capable of translating STEM advances into engineering innovations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is pilot testing the effectiveness of mechanics education by establishing the relation of material structure and solid mechanics, which can assist students in understanding complex and abstract concepts in engineering.  To understand whether the proposed approach can improve student learning and retention of course materials covered, Primary Trait Analysis, Student Assessment of Learning Gains Surveys, and individual student interviews are being used to analyze and compare students' learning outcomes with conventional methods.  Changes in Student Mental Model Representation are being analyzed through a language-oriented methodology for text and graphical representations of open problems.  Pre- and post-experiments are being used to compare and track changes in students' mental representation. The measures are also being used to compare control and treatment groups.  Students' perceptual and motivational characteristics are being assessed using a multi-scale questionnaire instrument previously designed and validated by project personnel.</AbstractNarration>
