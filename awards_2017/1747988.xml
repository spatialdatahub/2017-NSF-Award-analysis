<AbstractNarration>The National LSAMP Community has expressed a need for a resource document containing general information about each alliance and participants for collective dissemination purposes.  Also, there continues to be national requests for an updated directory of LSAMP alliances with sufficient contact information for each partnership.  Such documents were last published in 2011. The directory will serve as a quick reference for communicating with the alliances and a resource for university faculty, students and other professionals in STEM fields seeking to network with LSAMP participants.  The University of Alabama-Birmingham (UAB) will develop and publish both documents in four color format and distribute to the alliances.  UAB has a record of producing quality publications.  Both publications will be produced electronically and will have limited hardcopies for the alliances.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two documents in four color format will be disseminated to the LSAMP community.  Other interested individuals and organizations will be able to access this compilation of partnership information in electronic form.  The project's objectives are to provide a resource for faculty, students and others seeking to establish contact with students in a particular field; to foster networking among faculty and students at LSAMP institutions across the country; to alert the public to the educational and human resource impact of the LSAMP projects, collectively and individually, within geographic regions of the country; to provide a valuable resource document for the general science, technology, engineering and mathematics community; and to provide a valuable tool for the recruitment of students into research and graduate programs.</AbstractNarration>
