<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The mission of the Illinois Materials Research Science and Engineering Center is to perform fundamental, innovative materials research that has applications to societal needs, while supporting interdisciplinary education and training of students in materials design, understanding, and application. The scientific research comprises two highly interdisciplinary groups. The first group aims to revolutionize our ability to store and process information, via a new type of control of magnetism in materials known as anti-ferromagnets. In particular, the research focuses on controlling the behavior of these unconventional materials, which overcome the fundamental size and switching time limits of conventional magnetic memory storage such as currently used in computer disk drives. The second research group focuses on designing electronic materials that can withstand large deformations, such as bending and crumpling. Results of this research will enable many new applications, including wearable electronics and devices integrated with biological tissues, which require electronic materials that can be reversibly bent without degrading. The research activities of the Center are tightly integrated with education, outreach, and collaborative activities. Activities focused on science communication are designed to create a cadre of effective science communicators and enable the public to better assess and appreciate scientific results. Workshops and internships foster enhanced connections between academia, industry, and national labs. Advanced training for a diverse group of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers produces well-trained scientists who can push the boundaries of materials research in industry and academia, and increases the pipeline for the future scientific workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The mission of the Illinois Materials Research Science and Engineering Center is to perform fundamental, innovative research, broadly centered on understanding the dynamic properties of materials that has applications to societal needs, while supporting interdisciplinary education and training of students in materials design, understanding, and application. The research comprises two highly interdisciplinary groups. The Metallic Antiferromagnetic Materials: Ultrafast Charge, Lattice, and Magnetization Dynamics group advances understanding and control of metallic antiferromagnetic materials using ultrafast optics and currents, as well as fast temperature excursions. The key goal is to answer open questions concerning the coupling of magnetic order, optical fields, electronic excitations, and lattice vibrations that underlie fundamental limits on the control of magnetization dynamics. This work will enable the development of new technologies for information storage and processing. The Active Interfaces between Highly Deformable Nanomaterials group transforms understanding of the link between deformations of 2D heterostructures and molecular assemblies, and the resultant changes in electronic, chemical, and optical properties. It explores a novel regime where non-uniform deformations are large compared with material dimensions, resulting in emergent properties and functionalities. Applications include flexible, reconfigurable electronics and photonics, as well as new nano-bio technologies such as 3D sensors. The science of the Center facilitates breakthroughs in understanding and utilizing the dynamic properties of materials, advances applications in key areas, increases interest, knowledge and skills for a significant number of students at many levels, and both expands opportunities and increases the pipeline for the future scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
