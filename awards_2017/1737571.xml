<AbstractNarration>The proposal brings together a group of US atmospheric chemistry researchers from universities, government laboratories, and private research institutes, to promote discussion of information and ideas on topics of contemporary interest in atmospheric science through the internationally respected Gordon Research Conference. The theme of this year's conference is "Addressing the Complexity of Our Atmosphere Through Integration Across Scales."  The meeting will be held July 30 to August 3 in Newry, Maine.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the symposium derive from the exchange of ideas that help to focus the research community on the most pressing questions, as well as provide an opportunity for young scientists to meet, network, and exchange ideas with leaders in the atmospheric chemistry and related sciences.  Presentations will address the state-of-the-science of indoor air chemistry, remote atmospheric chemistry, connections across scales from molecular-level detail to global effects, model-measurement integration, measurement challenges associated with short-lived trace species, and fundamental chemistry in the gas-phase, in the condensed phase, and at interfaces between phases throughout the atmosphere.</AbstractNarration>
