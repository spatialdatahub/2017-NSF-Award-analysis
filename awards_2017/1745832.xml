<AbstractNarration>This grant provides financial support for the conference entitled the 13th World Congress of Computational Mechanics to be held jointly with the 2nd Pan American Congress of Computational Mechanics from July 22-27, 2018 in New York City. Building on the success of previous World Congresses since 1986, WCCM2018 is the premier forum for sharing and dissemination of the latest scientific and engineering advances in the field of computational mechanics. Computational Mechanics is the development and application of numerical methods and digital computers to the solution of problems faced in engineering and applied science with the objectives of understanding and harnessing the resources of nature. While Computational Solid Mechanics (CSM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) are at the traditional core areas of computational mechanics, subjects such as Thermodynamics, Electro-Magnetism, Rigid Body Mechanics, Control Systems, and Particle Physics also fall within the scope of the definition. WCCM2018 will bring together researchers, professionals, and engineers in a setting which facilitates rich discussions and interactions, and aims to highlight the important advances in WCCM on a global scale. Student participation is greatly encouraged to give the students exposure to recent advances in WCCM, and thus help prepare the next generation of leaders in this field. This meeting is open to all interested individuals, including a mixture of attendees from research, government, industry, and educational professions. Funding from this grant will support the travel of graduate students, early career researchers, and the Forum for Women in Engineering, with active focus on underrepresented group participation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;WCCM has helped to revolutionize multiple disciplines, ranging from vehicle crash simulation to petroleum reservoir modeling to additive manufacturing. The key topical areas that will be considered at WCCM2018 include: (1) computational biological science (2) computational material science (3) computational mathematics (4) computational engineering and design, (5) high performance computing, (6) verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification, (7) forum for women in engineering, (8) student poster competition and (9) networking initiatives worldwide. This world congress will include over 1000 presentations comprising four concurrent sessions, including a special symposium that explores the broadening participation of greater diversity in computational mechanics. The program has been designed to maximize interaction among modelers, applied mathematicians, experimentalists and engineers and provide a balance between breadth of information and depth of discussion and interaction opportunities; various types of institutions across academia, government, and industry will be represented. WCCM2018 will attempt to provide the most experientially diverse meeting possible, with a mixture of senior and junior investigators, post-doctoral trainees and students. Participation from minority groups will be particularly encouraged and supported.</AbstractNarration>
