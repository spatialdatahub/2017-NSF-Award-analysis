<AbstractNarration>The Summer Course on Grant Writing in the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SCG) at the University of Mississippi will provide early-career PhDs in the social, behavioral, and economic (SBE) sciences with mentorship and training in grant writing over the course of 3-years. A diverse cohort of between 12-14 early-career scientists who have or soon will obtain a PhD in the SBE sciences will be recruited to participate. The SCG should be of particular interest to individuals interested in the SBE Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (SPRF) program at NSF. Course content covers a broad spectrum of topics including but not limited to research design, conceptualizing a research project, developing a budget, and responding to program solicitations. The ultimate goal of the SCG is to support the development of several successful grant submissions and in turn, broaden participation of underrepresented groups in the SBE sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program accomplishes a number of goals: 1) To provide early-career scientists in the SBE disciplines, particularly members of underrepresented groups, with a brief appreciation of research design in the social sciences, including the links between research objectives, theory, methods, and data analysis; 2) help participants locate NSF and other federal research support that matches their research aspirations; establish a professional working relationship with program officers; and understand the proposal-review process; 3) To improve each participant?s ability to develop and write a scientifically well-conceived research proposal, using NSF?s proposal template as a model; and 4) To promote the spread of appropriate, robust scientific research in the SBE sciences in underrepresented communities through the diffusion of knowledge from participants to their peers and students.</AbstractNarration>
