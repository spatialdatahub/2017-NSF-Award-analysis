<AbstractNarration>Robots need to effectively interact with a large variety of objects&lt;br/&gt;that appear in warehouses and factories as well as homes and offices.&lt;br/&gt;This requires robust grasping and dexterous manipulation of everyday&lt;br/&gt;objects through low cost robots and low complexity solutions.&lt;br/&gt;Traditionally, robots use rigid hands and analytical models for such&lt;br/&gt;tasks, which often fail in the presence of even small errors. New&lt;br/&gt;compliant hands promise improved performance, while minimizing&lt;br/&gt;complexity, and increased robustness. Nevertheless, they are&lt;br/&gt;inherently difficult to sense and model. This project combines ideas&lt;br/&gt;from different robotics sub-fields to address this limitation. It&lt;br/&gt;utilizes progress in machine learning and builds on a strong tradition&lt;br/&gt;in robot modeling. The objective is to provide adaptive, compliant&lt;br/&gt;robots that are better in grasping objects in the presence of multiple&lt;br/&gt;unknown contact points and sliding or rolling objects in-hand. The&lt;br/&gt;broader impact will be strengthened by the open release of new or&lt;br/&gt;modified robot hand designs, improved control algorithms and software,&lt;br/&gt;as well as corresponding data sets. Furthermore, academic&lt;br/&gt;dissemination will be accompanied by educational outreach to&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Towards the above objective, the first step will be the definition of&lt;br/&gt;new hybrid models appropriate for adaptive, compliant hands.  This&lt;br/&gt;will happen by improving analytical solutions and extending them to&lt;br/&gt;allow adaptation based on data via novel, time-efficient learning&lt;br/&gt;methods. The objective is to capture model uncertainty inherent in&lt;br/&gt;real-world interactions; a process that suffers from data scarcity.&lt;br/&gt;In order to reduce the amount of data required for learning, different&lt;br/&gt;models will be tailored to specific tasks through an automated&lt;br/&gt;discovery of these tasks and of underlying motion primitives for each&lt;br/&gt;one of them. This task identification process will operate iteratively&lt;br/&gt;with learning and utilize improved models to discover new tasks. It&lt;br/&gt;can also provide feedback for improved hand design. Once these&lt;br/&gt;learning-based and task-focused models are available, they will be&lt;br/&gt;used to learn and synthesize controllers for grasping and in-hand&lt;br/&gt;manipulation. To learn controllers, this work will consider a&lt;br/&gt;model-based, reinforcement learning approach, which will be evaluated&lt;br/&gt;against alternatives. For controller synthesis, existing tools for&lt;br/&gt;this purpose will be integrated with task planning primitives and&lt;br/&gt;extended through learning processes to identify the preconditions&lt;br/&gt;under which different controllers can be chained together. The project&lt;br/&gt;involves extensive evaluation on a variety of novel adaptive hands and&lt;br/&gt;robotic arms designed in the PIs' labs. Modern vision-based solutions&lt;br/&gt;will be used to track grasped objects and provide feedback for&lt;br/&gt;learning and closed-loop control.  The evaluation will measure whether&lt;br/&gt;the developed hybrid models can significantly improve robustness of&lt;br/&gt;grasping and the effectiveness of dexterous manipulation.</AbstractNarration>
