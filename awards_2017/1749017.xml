<AbstractNarration>Cardiovascular disease, or heart disease, is the leading cause of death in the United States.  There are many types of heart disease, but all of them affect the mechanical performance of the heart in some way -- resulting in a heart that struggles to adequately pump blood to itself and/or the rest of the body.  Many devices are being developed to address the mechanical affects of heart disease, but proving that they can work safely and effectively before they are implanted in patients can be a challenge.  In addition, cardiovascular surgeons would like to be able to identify the best implant for a particular patient based on his or her anatomy and disease-effects.  High-quality engineering models offer a potential solution for addressing these challenges.  However, there are significant gaps in the currently available technology for modeling of cardiovascular disease. Despite significant advances in computational and laboratory simulation models, the ability to take advantage of these advances in a unified framework is still beyond reach. This project will help pioneer a new generation of cardiovascular biomechanics models capable of bridging computational and experimental approaches. The research objective is to implement and validate a complete, hybrid framework that integrates experimental (simulation) mechanics with computational physiology. This new framework will selectively harness the strengths while bypassing the limitations of the individual modeling approaches used. This advance will transform current medical device development and treatment planning methods, serving to reduce the amount of animal and human testing necessary, improve clinical decision support, reduce development costs, and expedite the availability of medical products to patients. The educational objectives based on this research include a pipeline of related programs spanning K-12 through graduate school, providing enhancements at every level, with a particular emphasis on increasing the inclusion of minority students. These educational enhancements will enrich STEM education and train the next generation of multidisciplinary engineers to tackle the most pressing medical needs of the aging US population (cardiovascular health), establishing a sustainable pipeline for continued training of young minds in biomedical STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will combine a realistic, computational physiology model with fluid dynamic simulations that will capture the autoregulation response of the heart and allow the integration of actual medical devices within the hybrid system.  By developing a hardware-in-the-loop system that combines computational and in vitro modeling, called a Physiology Modeling Coupled Experiment (PMCE), the project will advance cardiovascular modeling as a whole.  The first aim is to develop robust coupling methods to interface the computational and experimental domains, including: multiple experimental-computational interfaces; discontinuous flow and pressure waveforms; and simulations that include compliant elements.  The second aim is to develop a generalized computational physiology model that accounts for autoregulation, and will therefore produce realistic hemodynamics that can be related to patient characteristics such as body size, body mass index, age, fitness, and metabolic state.  The third aim will be to validate the hybrid model using clinical data that describes real world hemodynamics with various implants, including left ventricular assist devices, transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and Fontan cardiopulmonary assist systems.  The integrated educational activities will transition from public outreach at the K-12 level, including STEAM exhibits at the Artisphere Festival in Greenville, SC, through programs focused on transitioning to college, to undergraduate research, and transitioning to graduate school. All educational activities have established objectives, and the PI will assess the effectiveness of these activities so that changes can be made if appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
