<AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation award provides partial support for the 32nd Summer Conference on Topology and Its Applications to be held at the University of Dayton in Dayton, Ohio on June 27 - 30, 2017.  This conference series specializes in advancing the development of topological methods and applications to a broad range of areas including computer science, analysis, and algebra.  It maintains a tradition of an inclusive attitude towards developing new application areas.  This conference will bring together researchers across subfields of Topology, and across generations, to share the latest developments in Topology and related fields.  The organizing committee will ensure the representation of graduate students, young researchers, women, and researchers from underrepresented groups.  All sessions will host a mix of talks by established specialists, graduate students, and early career mathematicians.  Talks will be centered on recent advances and techniques that impact the future of the discipline.  In keeping with tradition, conference proceedings will be published by the peer-reviewed journal Topology Proceedings.  Additionally we plan to video and live stream the invited talks. This way, the latest developments in Topology will be broadly shared.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This year the conference will focus on five research themes in the topology plus model: topology + algebra and analysis, topology + asymmetric structures, topology + dynamics and continuum theory, topology + foundations, and topology + geometry.  There will be a workshop on monotone covering properties, and one on entropy in topological groups.  These fields were chosen to be representative of the broad range of research being actively pursued today.  The conference structure will promote  interaction between these diverse fields by having one plenary talk in each field, providing workshops where interested parties can learn about new fields, and by providing dedicated collaboration space and social space where researchers can discuss problems informally.  The conference will invite one plenary speaker from each of these fields along with the Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher Award winner.
