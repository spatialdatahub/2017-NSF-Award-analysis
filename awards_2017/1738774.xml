<AbstractNarration>An award is made to the University of South Carolina to support the Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center (PGSC).  Animals of the genus Peromyscus are the most abundant and widely distributed North American mammals.  Due to a series of characteristics, Peromyscus emerged as a model of choice for the study of major biological processes such as speciation, adaptation and stress response, behavior adaptation in the context of physiology and evolution, host-parasite interactions, microbiome-associated studies and others.  The PGSC facilitates biological research and workforce development through training of undergraduate and graduate students in Peromyscus-related research.  It also assists internal and external investigators in their research projects and provides training in animal handling and manipulation. The PGSC also operates as a focal point for Peromyscus-associated research through its Newsletter that is published twice a year and the maintenance of a website that disseminates information that is of interest to investigators using Peromyscus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PGSC maintains and distributes outbred stocks of Peromyscus and several behavioral and coat-color mutants. In addition, it provides biological samples of various species, such as fresh, frozen and preserved tissues, DNA, fecal and blood samples and in response to external requests performs small-scale research projects to facilitate external investigators research needs. In view of the increasing concerns of the scientific community for transparency and reproducibility of the scientific results, the existence and regular operation of the PGSC warrants the availability of animals of verified quality, health, genetic and physiological status and of their unbiased and uninterrupted supply to investigators requesting them. These activities are of particular value to NSF supported investigators who require diversified animals of reliable genetic and physiological state.</AbstractNarration>
