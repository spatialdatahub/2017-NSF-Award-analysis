<AbstractNarration>Critical to the health and resiliency of the Internet is the underlying security of the systems that make our online world a reality.  By bringing together leaders in cyber security, including leading-edge security researchers and implementers, globally recognized security-technology experts, and users from both the private and public sectors, the Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium fosters information exchange among researchers and practitioners of network and distributed system security. The target audience (usually around 300 people) includes those interested in practical aspects of network and distributed system security, with a focus on system design and practical implementation.   The February 2017 conference in San Diego will be the 24th NDSS symposia, demonstrating its longevity and its importance as the leading conference in network and distributed system security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students often have limited sources of funds for travel to conferences and limited opportunities to interact with in-the-field practitioners. NSF financial support will assist nineteen (19) US-based graduate and undergraduate students so that they may attend this meeting. Each travel grant is intended to cover conference registration, lodging during the conference, and as much as possible of the student?s travel (e.g., economy airfare). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participation in symposia like the NDSS is a critical part of the students' educational experiences, providing them the opportunity to interact with senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work in the field. Regardless of the field, investing in the development of human capital is crucial for the future.  Supporting and nurturing the next generation of network security experts, providing them with an opportunity to learn from and engage with established experts benefits the entire community.  Each provides the other with lessons learned, fresh ideas, and infuses a spirit of collaboration among a rather small sub-section of the technical space.</AbstractNarration>
