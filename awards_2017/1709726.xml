<AbstractNarration>Homology is one of the most fundamental and useful invariants of topological spaces and is a measure of the number generalized "holes" in a topological space.  Homology theory has applications in as disparate areas of mathematics as algebraic topology, number theory, mathematical physics, data science, and even economics where it is used to show the existence of Nash equilibria. Homology is useful only to the extent to which one can calculate it. Oftentimes the spaces that one is interested in come in natural infinite families. An interesting phenomenon that simplifies homology calculations for many of these families is homological stability.  Examples of spaces exhibiting homological stability are ubiquitous in group theory, low dimensional topology, algebraic geometry, and number theory. This research project aims to broaden and deepen understanding of homological stability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the study of homological stability as well as some generalizations, representation stability, coefficient dependent homological stability, and secondary stability. Representation stability concerns the controlled growth of the homology groups of spaces with group actions. Coefficient dependent homological stability involves studying sequences of spaces where the integral homology does not stabilize but some patterns exist if one works with mod p or p-local coefficients. Secondary stability entails exploring stability patterns in the unstable homology groups of spaces exhibiting various forms of stability. The first two generalizations broaden the class of spaces that fall under the scope of homological stability. In contrast, secondary stability significantly increases the amount of information that one can extract from a sequence of spaces using stability techniques. The investigator will explore these generalizations of homological stability with the goal of proving new stability results for congruence and Torelli-type groups as well as configuration spaces.</AbstractNarration>
