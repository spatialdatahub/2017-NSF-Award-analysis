<AbstractNarration>The University of California Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory (BML) will establish a fiber-optic local area network that is high-performance, fault-tolerant, and adaptable. BML is located in a remote region of the Northern California coast, despite the remote location, BML has access to available bandwidth up to 10 GB/s through AT&amp;T's fiber service, comparable to bandwidth offerings in major metropolitan areas but the aged, internal local area network infrastructure (developed when the WAN bandwidth was 1.5Mbps) is a severe limitation. BML's fiber internet connection is currently analogous to a "new superhighway", however BML's internal connection to the outside (WAN) is analogous to a "bumpy gravel road" slowing down the advantage that the external high speed infrastructure can provide. The new high performance internal architecture is designed to support research, instruction, public education, and data acquisition/dissemination; both across the facility and beyond. BML is situated in a scientifically relevant location. It is the primary open-coast research facility for research in upwelling environments along the California coast. Sophisticated technical resources include ample bandwidth (external internet access), network storage, video conferencing capability, access to long-term atmospheric, oceanographic, and biological data, BML- and agency-operated sensor networks, an ocean-observing node, University library resources, seawater system, pathogen containment facilities, climate change research facilities, access to the 362-acre Bodega Marine Reserve, and specialized laboratory instruments and microscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enhanced network capacity provides both UC Davis researchers, visiting researchers, post docs, and students with bandwidth sufficient to easily explore, discover, analyze and utilize data at other sites as well as local data sources. Further, education and outreach programs, both at BML and elsewhere will benefit directly from the enhanced infrastructure. Public education programs will be able to disseminate science directly to the public and public visitors to BML will learn about research via high-quality, interactive computer-driven interpretive displays that will access data products across the local area network. Research at UC Davis BML is highly interdisciplinary particularly in the impacts of climate change on ecosystems, with a strong linkage between physical land-sea interface data (e.g. oceanographic, meterological) and biological responses. Strong collaborations between the Bodega Ocean Observing Node and the Bodega Ocean Acidification Research  group means that large physical data sets are shared and integrated into biological (genomic and transcriptomic) data on a routine basis. The critically endangered white abalone captive breeding program under a federal ESA permit is located at BML and generates very large High Definition and 360-degree video and image files for analysis of larvae and feeding by broodstock. For data of this scale, the current LAN inhibits routine file transfer or backup during working hours. Often backup or simple file transfer between labs can take overnight. Examples of 'big data' challenges at BML include accessing computing clusters for genome and transcriptome analyses of populations of marine invertebrates as well as proteomic analyses from endangered species (white abalone) for assessment of reproductive conditioning. High-resolution numerical models and management of high-resolution ocean-observing data (e.g., high frequency radar, pCO2, O2, conductivity, fluorescence, etc.) provide the basis for biological responses to climate change as related to changes in normal upwelling patterns. Interdisciplinary environmental research intensity, diversity and collaborations are growing rapidly in part due to the coalescence of more than 90 marine science and policy faculty at UC Davis as part of the new Coastal and Marine Sciences Institute.</AbstractNarration>
