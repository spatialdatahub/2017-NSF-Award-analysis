<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a novel integrated circuit (IC) power estimation simulation technology into an integrated simulation tool that is superior to the current state-of-the-art.   The Scalable Accelerated Power Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SAP-SPICE) will drastically improve the way IC manufacturers design, fabricate, and test modern chips by significantly increasing the speed and the accuracy of the power estimation simulations.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gap as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  While the gold-standard simulation tool HSPICE produces the most accurate result, it comes at a high computational cost.  On the other hand, accelerated simulators are faster because they depend on larger component models but they produce less accurate average results.  The SAP-SPICE project uses a different approach with logic design, a logic simulator, and a portion of power data to extract a more accurate result while maintaining fast computational speed.  The goal of this project is to produce a preproduction quality prototype that will integrate with existing industry standard tools to demonstrate the advantages of the technology over other tools to potential customers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SAP-SPICE will have broader impacts on several fronts. First, the tool can lead to significant societal and environmental benefit when it is used by the chip manufacturers to improve the chip yield. Second, the techniques developed for the product have potential broader applicability to other areas of computing such as large server systems, mobile devices, and consumer appliances; especially in a future where a fine-grained energy accounting will be an integral part of all computing devices. Beyond its impact on technology, the project will also contribute to workforce development through educational benefits to the students participating in the project who will be organized in a structure similar to a small business, encouraged to find innovative solutions on a short timeline, and will meet weekly with the business mentor.</AbstractNarration>
