<AbstractNarration>A real-time mechanically flexible biosensor for medical applications is the focus of the current effort due to low-cost and mass manufacturing capability. The proposed new diagnostic approach will use a display device for detecting an important biomarker that indicates heart failure. If successfully demonstrated, the proposed technology will lead to the development of flexible and wearable biosensors with effective manufacturability that can provide real-time assessment of heart status directly to the wearer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop a light-emitted-display (LED)-enabled biosensor on flexible substrates that can be used to detect B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), a cardiovascular disease biomarker, as well as other biomarkers. Flexible and real-time diagnostic devices are attractive because of their simplicity, fast response, and low manufacturing cost. It is proposed to use a 2-dimensional conducting polymer to fabricate an LED-enabled biosensor on the flexible platform for real-time analysis. First, polyaniline-based biosensor and a LED device on the flexible substrate will be integrated for enabling in situ measurement.  Second, characterization and tests will be performed using clinical human serum samples. Upon antigen binding, the LED will emit red light whose intensity is proportional to BNP concentration. It is hypothesized that the drain current will be directly correlated to BNP concentrations, thus it can provide for quantification of BNP in human serum. Clinical blood samples from heart patients will be acquired from the University of Pittsburgh Medicine Center (UPMC). The proposed investigation can potentially lead to an important new tool for diagnosing biomarkers, resulting in significantly contributing to public health and diagnostic technology.</AbstractNarration>
