<AbstractNarration>Georgia State University?s Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) is an optical/near-infrared interferometric telescope array located on Mount Wilson, California. The CHARA Array has six 1-meter diameter telescopes placed in the shape of a Y, letting astronomers use different lines of telescopes grouped together from the Y to look at different astronomical objects.  The number and size of the telescopes, the lengths of these telescope lines, the range of wavelengths covered, and its ability to image targets in astronomy, make CHARA one of the most powerful telescope facilities of its type.  Since 2005, when CHARA started operating regularly, the scientists using CHARA have had significant scientific results.  These scientists are now opening the CHARA telescope array to astronomers from other institutions. This project serves the national interest by supporting a unique telescope system to promote the study of multiple, different astronomical objects, advancing the progress of astronomy.  GSU will develop CHARA-related hands-on experiences for their introductory and advanced undergraduate classes.  Located on Mount Wilson, the Exhibit Hall telling the story of CHARA?s operation and successes will also be updated for the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CHARA group publications include the first direct images of a single, main-sequence star (Altair), starspots on a giant star (Gamma And), an interacting binary (Beta Lyr), and the expanding fireball of a nova (Nova Del 2013).  Among many current applications, CHARA instruments measure stellar angular diameters, stellar shapes, map surface features, detect circumstellar disks and envelopes, and resolve binary stars to determine stellar masses and probe different stages of the evolution of interacting systems. With the introduction of adaptive optics at each of the six telescopes, CHARA Array observations will extend to protoplanetary disks around young stars, binary star systems (including novae, symbiotic stars, and microquasars), as well as the accretion disks in some active galactic nuclei. Each of these applications can be done with both high spectral and high spatial resolution.</AbstractNarration>
