<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) supports conferences that seek to increase the research capacity of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty at HBCUs. North Carolina Central University will collaborate with the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill to host a Conference on Nonparametric Statistics at the Hill Alumni Center, Chapel Hill, NC, on October 16-17, 2018. About eighty faculty and students from North Carolina Central University will attend this conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data in biomedical sciences, the social sciences, and other fields often involve non-standard designs and very high dimensions with relatively small sample sizes with complex dependency structure.  Standard models and associated statistical packages, mostly based on parametric statistics, are often of limited scope in these complex set-ups. For such models, nonparametric approaches would apply. This conference is to bring together scholars, researchers, educators, students and professionals who are interested in this important area of statistics. A key objective is to provide researchers and students from North Carolina Central University with the opportunity to interact with a group of researchers and to strengthen capacity in this area of statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
