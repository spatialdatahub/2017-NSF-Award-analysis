<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project has its origins in the use of Mesh-free Monte Carlo methods as a novel technology for simulation of multi-physics, multi-scale systems. This project's mesh-free simulation approach is applied to superconducting system design.  The lack of engineering tools for integrated analysis and design of superconducting coils, in particular for complex phenomena such as superconducting quench, is a bottleneck that hinders the development of reliable superconducting systems.  This project addresses the design and simulation of superconducting devices, enabling reliable, computationally efficient modeling, simulation and analysis of complex phenomena such as quench in full scale systems. Mesh-free modeling tools for multi-physics analysis of multi-scale systems benefit  applications where large dimensions or multi-scale geometries makes meshing computationally prohibitive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project involves software tools and simulation techniques for multi-physics simulation of multi-scale systems based on mesh-free Monte Carlo methods. The approach enables the computationally efficient simulation of coupled systems with multi-scale geometries where proper meshing for conventional finite element methods becomes prohibitive. The project enables a complete study of the potential commercialization of the software tools and simulation techniques being developed, as well as an assessment of technical areas and commercial applications which could benefit from the proposed approach for simulation of multi-scale systems. The project could enable simulation of multi-scale, multi-physics problems in a wide variety of potential applications based on a novel approach: mesh-free floating random walk Monte Carlo methods and may enable simulation of systems that are currently intractable using conventional finite element tools.</AbstractNarration>
