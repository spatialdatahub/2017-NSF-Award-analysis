<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program provides support for projects to design, implement, and assess strategies that can lead to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. The project at Morgan State University seeks to address the roadblocks encountered by students during the freshmen year experience in STEM disciplines with targeted interventions. The overall goal is to significantly increase the retention rate of underrepresented minority students at the University choosing career paths in STEM majors, graduate programs, and workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities that are part of this project are: a six-week pre-college transition program to enhance retention and persistence of a number of incoming freshmen in the School of Computer, Mathematical and Natural Sciences; development of an interdisciplinary lab-based research course and core student research laboratory; and integration of critical thinking activities and assessment into freshmen STEM curricula.  The activities and strategies are evidence-based  and what is learned through this project can serve as a model for other institutions.</AbstractNarration>
