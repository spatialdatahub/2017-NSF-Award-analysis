<AbstractNarration>Overview: Deep neural networks (DNN) have become the de-facto standard tool to carry out complex learning&lt;br/&gt;tasks. DNNs belong to the second generation of artificial neural networks (ANNs), which rely on neurons&lt;br/&gt;that implement memory-less non-linear transformations of the synaptic inputs. Motivated by the biological&lt;br/&gt;analogy with the behavior of neurons in the brain, the third generation of neural networks, also referred to&lt;br/&gt;as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), was introduced in the nineties. In SNNs, synaptic input and neuronal&lt;br/&gt;output signals are spike trains. This proposal argues that the time for the use of SNNs as machine learning&lt;br/&gt;tools has come, and sets forth a systematic approach for the design and implementation of SNNs as learning&lt;br/&gt;and inference machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: SNNs have a number of unique advantages as compared to ANNs: (i) They are event-based&lt;br/&gt;systems with natural sparsity properties, which have the potential to make deep learning machines feasible for&lt;br/&gt;energy-limited devices; (ii) They are uniquely capable to natively process data that comes in the form of timeencoded&lt;br/&gt;processes, for example, from bio-inspired sensors. The main goal of this project is the establishment&lt;br/&gt;of a theoretical framework to enable the design of flexible spike-domain learning algorithms that are tailored&lt;br/&gt;to the solution of supervised and unsupervised cognitive tasks, as well as their co-optimization on nanoscale&lt;br/&gt;hardware architectures. To this end, this project puts forth a principled probabilistic framework based on the&lt;br/&gt;graphical formalism of Directed Information Graphs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The outcome of this research is expected to have a profound impact on the increasing number&lt;br/&gt;of practical applications that are based on the processing of time-encoded signals, including biological sensors&lt;br/&gt;and next-generation communication systems, and/or that require the adoption of computing solutions with a&lt;br/&gt;significantly smaller power budget as compared to conventional DNNs. The research methodology is based&lt;br/&gt;on a multi-disciplinary approach that integrates machine learning, information theory, probabilistic graphical&lt;br/&gt;models, neuromorphic computing and device/system architecture at the nanoscale. The educational plan at&lt;br/&gt;the home institution targets both undergraduate and graduate students via hands-on learning and experimentation&lt;br/&gt;activities.</AbstractNarration>
