<AbstractNarration>NSF actively promotes the inclusion of students in technical conferences and in the advancement of scientific research. To this affect the PI requests that the CCSS program, within the ECCS Division of the Engineering Directorate at the NSF, sponsor a select number of students to participate in the 7th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology, to be held in Pittsburgh, PA on July 25-28, 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student Travel Fellowship is requested for the 2017 IEEE Nanotechnology Conference for domestic student (undergraduate and graduate) participants and presenters. The conference, which has been held sixteen times previously, brings together researchers and educators focused on developing nanotechnologies and applying these technologies to space, electronic, magnetic, sensor, and photonic devices and systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested support will be used to provide partial travel stipends for student participants at the conference, specifically student presenters in an organized session.  NSF funding will be used to support travel, of domestic graduate and undergraduate students in the form of hotel accommodation. Fifteen (15) student participants will receive funding to support their participation in the 7th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
