<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a smart material technology to fill the need for an electronic device for people with vision impairment to read braille texts and tactile graphics. The braille electronic readers will greatly impact the underserved population with vision impairment: (1) providing blind children with convenient availability of braille text, math equations, maps, and graphic images; (2) providing convenient means of communication for the 21 million Americans and 314 million people worldwide who suffer from vision impairment; and (3) better access to public transportation through the adoption of public dynamic braille displays such as time tables for public transportation and signs in public buildings and on streets. The project will result in a prototype tactile device having the area of a smartphone screen size to display 40 braille characters at a time. The contents can be refreshed. Compared to existing braille electronic readers, the new devices will be 10 times more compact yet 10 times cheaper, such that every person in need can own their personal copy like a smartphone or iPad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gap as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. There is a lack of a transducer material that allows for large, out of plane deformation from a flat surface to forming raised dot, in a compact form factor and with low energy consumption. The researchers have innovated a new smart material that is capable of large-strain rigid-to-rigid actuation and thus exactly bridges the critical material gap. In combination with formation of an array of compliant electrodes, a refreshable braille dot array will be fabricated meeting the braille standard. This project will demonstrate a prototype device and investigate options for active matrix driving circuitry and control software. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A postdoctoral researcher and two undergraduate interns will participate in the project, and interact with a senior researcher with extensive industrial R&amp;D background and a business consultant to receive training experience in technology innovation and translation. The project will help educate these junior researchers with technology-driven thinking and entrepreneurship that are unavailable in regular academic learning.</AbstractNarration>
