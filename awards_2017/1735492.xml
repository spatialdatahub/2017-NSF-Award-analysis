<AbstractNarration>This award will fund a laboratory technician in the Helium Geothermochronology Laboratory (HGL) at the University of Connecticut. The HGL supports research in low-temperature (U-Th)/He thermochronology of a wide range of minerals, including apatite, zircon, titanite, and monazite. This award will enable the broader Earth science community to gain access to the HGL facility and will support visitor training and applications and development in geothermochronology. This laboratory technician support award will also promote science in society by providing student training and education in a laboratory setting, enhancing the research program of an early career geoscientist, and promoting engagement of local Mansfield, CT community through science outreach activities centering on deep time and dating methods in the tectonics, geochemistry, sedimentology, paleoclimatology, and geoarchaeology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research in the HGL focuses on resolving the timing and mechanisms of exhumation during mountain building, with specific concentration on sediment provenance analysis using detrital multi-mineral (U-Th)/He geothermochronology. This award will support HGL efforts to develop improved methodology on a wider suite of detrital minerals, such as titanite, monazite, and apatite, among others. The laboratory technician will be expected to (1) supervise on-campus and visiting students and researchers, (2) contribute to ongoing research and methodological development of (U-Th)/He geothermochronology at UConn, (3) conduct routine laboratory duties and instrument maintenance, (4) provide fee-for-service analytical support for scientific and applied research projects, and (5) participate in community outreach activities to promote public interest and knowledge in deep-time, geochronology, and Earth processes.</AbstractNarration>
