<AbstractNarration>This project aims to discover novel mechanisms that control the uptake and distribution&lt;br/&gt;of iron in plants. Part of the impetus for such discovery research is that iron deficiency&lt;br/&gt;is one of the most significant micronutrient malnutrition problems facing the world&lt;br/&gt;today. The World Health Organization estimates that ~1.62 billion people--~25% of the&lt;br/&gt;world's population-- are affected by iron deficiency. The production of staple crops that&lt;br/&gt;have elevated iron in edible parts (e.g., in the grains of cereals) is widely regarded as the&lt;br/&gt;primary means by which this problem could be stably addressed. However, this goal is&lt;br/&gt;thwarted because our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms controlling iron&lt;br/&gt;accumulation in plants is far from complete. The scientists conducting this project have&lt;br/&gt;discovered that three distinct iron transporter proteins are required in the leaves of&lt;br/&gt;plants in order for those leaves to send correct signals of iron deficiency to the roots.&lt;br/&gt;Since the roots take up iron in response to signals from the leaves, investigation of the&lt;br/&gt;leaf transporters will reveal new mechanisms that plants use to control iron uptake. In&lt;br/&gt;addition to these scientific goals, the researchers will work to enhance educational&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for undergraduates and K-12 students through the development of multimedia&lt;br/&gt;web modules for K-12 outreach, and the development of course based&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate research experiences (CURES).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior work on the regulation and localization of Arabidopsis iron transporters, OPT3,&lt;br/&gt;YSL1 and YSL3 has indicated that they have opposite but indispensable roles in&lt;br/&gt;controlling shoot-to-root signaling of iron status. A working hypothesis that explains&lt;br/&gt;current observations is that OPT3 and YSL1/YSL3 together modulate phloem companion&lt;br/&gt;cell Fe status, and that low concentrations of Fe in the companion cells results in the&lt;br/&gt;production of a phloem mobile signal that initiates iron deficiency regulated gene&lt;br/&gt;expression in roots. In this project, a combination of transporter activity studies, protein&lt;br/&gt;localization, and highly accurate determination of the metal distribution in veins will test&lt;br/&gt;this hypothesis. The project scientists have established the presence of a phloem-mobile&lt;br/&gt;inductive RNA signal that is capable of inducing iron deficiency associated gene&lt;br/&gt;expression in excised roots. Because a simple assay system for the phloem mobile&lt;br/&gt;signal has been developed, profiling experiments coupled with downstream genetic&lt;br/&gt;analyses will be used to identify the phloem mobile signal produced in iron deficient&lt;br/&gt;leaves that regulates root gene expression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
