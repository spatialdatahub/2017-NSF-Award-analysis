<AbstractNarration>This award will support the PI and undergraduate students working with him to understand the ways in which neutrons decay and how long a free neutron will exist before decaying.  Neutrons which are not bound in an atomic nucleus will decay in about 880 seconds into a proton, electron and an antineutrino.    Studying characteristics of this property of neutrons with increasing precision allows a deeper knowledge about the framework upon which the cosmos was built. One experiment, named aCORN, has collected data at the National Institute of Standards and Technology Center for Neutron Research to measure the correlation between the emission directions of the electron and antineutrino more precisely than ever before.  Another experiment, UCNtau, is using magnets and gravity to trap very low energy neutrons to measure the neutron's lifetime to less than a second. Experiments trapping very low energy neutrons and subsequently counting the undecayed survivors after a period of time are tending to give results significantly different than experiments which involve a higher energy beam of neutrons and the detection of protons produced in the decay. Finding the cause of this discrepancy is of great interest as it has the potential of uncovering a new feature of neutron decay. This award will allow the Principle Investigator (PI) and DePauw University Undergraduate Researchers to make important contributions to these two experiments.  The aCORN experiment has been the flagship project of the PI's research program, which in many ways has acted as a training ground for his students to prepare them for research and teaching.  The students who participate in this research gain a broad range of hardware and software skills that prepare them for careers in STEM fields or to pursue graduate degrees also in STEM areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motivations for a more precise measurement of the electron-antineutrino correlation include an improved model independent test of the Electroweak Standard Model and a measurement of the ratio of weak axial vector to vector coupling constants that does not depend on neutron polarimetry. In addition, this measurement, along with a more precise neutron lifetime, would allow a determination of Vud - an element of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix - solely from free neutron decay and thus not complicated by nuclear structure dependent corrections. As the CKM matrix is required to be unitary, this would provide a test of the Standard Model.  Knowing the neutron lifetime better also allows for a stringent test of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.  The aCORN experiment depends on the simultaneous detection of electrons and protons to infer the relative emission direction of the antineutrino. The PI has developed a proton tracking simulation that determines the efficiency of the aCORN proton focusing system for the first data set which is important in establishing the size of the systematic error that would result from imperfect proton detection. The PI will apply this analysis to the second data set and fully analyze the NG-C data. The techniques used in the aCORN proton simulation will be employed to design a proton detector system in the UCNtau experiment to allow determination of the neutron lifetime by observation of the protons which is closer to what the neutron beam lifetime experiments actually measure. Such a measurement could be instrumental in understanding the discrepancy between these experiments.</AbstractNarration>
