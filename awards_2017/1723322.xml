<AbstractNarration>Dr. Michael E. Smith, Arizona State University, and a team of colleagues from the United States, Mexico, and Canada, will investigate the nature of early urbanism at the archaeological site of Teotihuacan, Mexico, one of the largest cities in the ancient New World. As cities become the dominant form of settlement in the world today, knowledge about the successful cities of the past can inform understanding of contemporary urbanism. The spatial patterns of urban expansion and decline in past cities show how city growth is connected to broader economic and political forces. This information can help scholars and planners devise strategies for improving cities and city life today. Much of this project will take place at the Arizona State University Teotihuacan Research Laboratory in Mexico, a facility that stores artifacts and anchors research at the site. The laboratory is a major piece of scientific infrastructure for archaeological research in Mexico, and its value will be strengthened by this project. Training will be provided for a postdoctoral scholar and both graduate and undergraduate students. Dr. Smith will create a comprehensive data archive for Teotihuacan that will benefit many researchers, and this work will contribute to the public understanding of science through various outreach activities designed to educate the public about Teotihuacan and ancient cities more generally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As one of the largest and most extensively studied ancient cities of the New World, the World Heritage Site of Teotihuacan holds important clues about ancient urban life. This project will complete the work of prior research at the site and ensure that the scientific results of past and present archaeological projects at Teotihuacan are made available for the public and for scholars now and in the future. Dr. Smith's team will complete artifact analyses, organize field notes and records into databases, archive the data on tDAR (The Digital Archaeological Record), and write reports on the research. These activities will permit a series of research questions to be answered for the first time. Teotihuacan had a unique form of social and political organization, including ethnic neighborhoods, and its residents maintained a remarkably high level of material prosperity. Were these two features related? How did the city's leaders and residents manage to create and maintain a successful city over a period of more than five centuries? What was the relationship between the city's major craft economy - obsidian tool production - and its growth and decline? More generally, what specific lessons do early cities have for urbanization today? This project will build on the foundation of a detailed archaeological map of Teotihuacan and an important yet incomplete database, to generate new findings and to archive data and results for future generations.</AbstractNarration>
