<AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation award provides partial support for the event "Chromatic Homotopy Theory: Journey to the Frontier" that will take place May 16-20, 2018 at the University of Colorado, Boulder. This five day event will consist of a two-day workshop followed by a three-day conference. The goal is to promote the work of young researchers in the field, while providing an opportunity for graduate students and early career mathematicians from smaller and/or underfunded institutions to meet the experts in a friendly and thriving environment. Confirmed speakers for the conference come from across the world, including America, Asia and Europe. This meeting will help increase communication and collaboration among the worldwide topology community. The event will be filmed and made available on the internet, thereby broadening its impact. Resources on chromatic homotopy theory are sparse and these videos will also help increase the accessibility of the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chromatic homotopy theory is a deep and difficult branch of homotopy theory which has undergone significant computational and conceptual advances in the recent past. These advances often involve ideas at the interplay of algebraic geometry, number theory, higher category theory, and even quantum field theory. The primary scientific aim of this conference is to survey some of these connections and their impact on the field today. The research of the invited speakers is on the forefront of new developments in the field. Most of them are early career mathematicians whose work is influencing the discipline in new and innovative ways. The workshop preceding the conference will consist of a mini-course covering some of the background necessary for younger participants to fully benefit from the conference. Some of the very best researchers in chromatic homotopy theory will be contributing to the lectures of the workshop.
