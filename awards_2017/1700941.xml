<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating the single-frame instant-focusing scheme to fill the need for high-throughput whole slide imaging (WSI).  WSI refers to scanning conventional glass slides in order to create digital slides which can then be used for diagnostic purposes via a computer where they can be viewed, managed and analyzed. It is the most recent imaging modality being employed by pathology departments worldwide and continues to gain traction for diagnostic, educational, and research purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed innovation is important because it can address the challenges of high-throughput microscopy imaging and lower the cost barrier of brightfield and fluorescence whole slide imaging for the biological research and medical diagnostic markets. The project will result in a WSI product prototype that has the following unique features: 1) it can rapidly and precisely detect the sample position over a long axial range without mechanical z-scanning, 2) it is able to handle transparent and low-contrast samples, 3) it can provide multiple imaging modalities in the same platform, and 4) it requires minimum hardware modification to an existing microscope platform. These features lead to a better imaging quality, a higher throughput performance, and a cost saving when compared to the competing WSI products in this market space.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the technology gap of the time-consuming autofocusing process as it translates from research discovery toward commercial applications. By employing a dual-pinhole aperture or a dual-LED illuminator for autofocusing, the optimal focal position of the sample can be precisely detected over a long axial range in real time. The single-frame detection nature of the proposed innovation also allows autofocusing even when the stage is in continuous motion and the focus errors will not be accumulated to other spatial positions. In addition, personnel involved in this project, including undergraduates and graduates, will receive entrepreneurship and technology translation experiences through the "Accelerate UConn" program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages business partners from Dover Motion to guide commercialization aspects in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.</AbstractNarration>
