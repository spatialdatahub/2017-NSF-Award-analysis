<AbstractNarration>One of the main ways that astronomers study the universe is by splitting the telescope light from celestial sources into its component colors.  This technique, known as spectroscopy, can often reveal the underlying processes that govern stars, galaxies and the like.  A traditional astronomical spectrograph obtains color information at the expense of imaging.  However, a modern Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectrograph is able to do both.  An IFU obtains an image and a spectrum at each pixel of the image of an astronomical source.  The resulting data cube can be studied to determine the spatial distribution of light across a single extended object, or it can be used to study multiple stars or galaxies at once.   This project will support the development of an IFU system for the Magellan/Clay telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory.  When completed, this instrument will enable a wide range of investigations into topics from the formation of young stars to the dynamics of gas outflows in distant galaxies.  In addition to providing a new tool for research, this project will also serve as an essential training opportunity for students and early career scientists. Live feeds from the telescope will be used in conjunction with undergraduate classes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds upon the previous MRI award, 0923160 (PI: Mateo), which funded the development of the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System (M2FS) spectrograph.   The M2FS system actually consists of two high-performance optical spectrographs that deliver resolution, R, in the range 1000 to 40,000 over a wavelength range 370-950 nm.  Since commissioning in 2013, M2FS has been used to support over 30 distinct science projects proposed by 18 different investigators.  This project will develop multi-mode Integral Field Units for Magellan (IFU-M), to be used in conjunction with M2FS.  One key design innovation that enables this instrument is the use of fiber gangs, which handle O(10) optical fibers at once for faster fabrication and assembly.  Fabrication and assembly will take place at the PI?s lab at the University of Michigan; the completed instrument will be deployed at the Nasmyth focus of the Magellan/Clay telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, where it will undergo commissioning and use as a facility instrument.</AbstractNarration>
