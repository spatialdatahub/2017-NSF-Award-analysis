<AbstractNarration>This workshop on Diversifying and Deepening Engagement and Learning in STEM will bring together researchers from the United States and the Netherlands to exchange ideas and foster collaboration. Internationally, there is broad recognition that far too narrow a segment of the population is deeply engaged with and knowledgeable about STEM. This narrow engagement negatively affects the prospects of individuals across the globe. Diversifying the pool of children and young adults deeply engaged with STEM, and providing them with well-supported opportunities for deeper learning in STEM, will promote the progress of STEM by positively impacting research and development. Diversity of thought, perspective, experience and quality of preparation improve innovation and the quality of STEM research. The workshop and its products will advance STEM education by enhancing scholars' knowledge of relevant research on diversifying and deepening engagement and learning, and by creating stronger ties among researchers with common interests in and commitment to these issues. STEM education efforts sparked by this workshop will advance national health, prosperity, and welfare by improving individuals' quality of life and enabling broader public participation in democratic processes that are informed by STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop involves a select group of influential scholars from the U.S. and Netherlands whose work contributes to innovative research and development on STEM education both within and beyond schools. The workshop's theme refers to the key goal of diversifying the pool of young people deeply engaged with STEM, including groups historically underrepresented globally and in each nation, while also fostering deeper STEM learning. Throughout the workshop, participants will examine two questions: (1) What are the key social, cultural, and systemic contexts that facilitate and impede broadening STEM participation and learning? (2) How might researchers better understand them, and educators better address them? Comparative work across the U.S. and Netherlands national contexts will allow for bidirectional illumination of issues that might otherwise appear to be merely given or inevitable when examined from a single national standpoint. Gathered scholars will explore the challenges and opportunities for supporting and sustaining interest in, identification with, and deep learning of STEM among young people, through informal and formal learning opportunities. A key outcome of the workshop will be a white paper made freely and widely available to the STEM education community and the general public. The white paper will summarize existing literature and the discussion, framings, and suggestions for further research. The process of constructing and finalizing the white paper will focus the attention of participants in the workshop, and result in greater clarity about the body of theory and research that can inform educational action and future research. In addition, interest groups that form during the workshop will consider pursuing additional products that can inform the STEM education community, such as a journal special issue, an edited volume, research and practice briefs, or other collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
