<AbstractNarration>The University of Tennessee at Knoxville will host the fall meeting of the Palmetto Number Theory Series (PANTS) in September of 2017. The local organizers will be Luis Finotti and Marie Jameson.  The second meeting will be hosted at Clemson University at the beginning of December; local organizers will be Jim Brown, Kevin James, and Hui Xue.  The third meeting of the year, the Southeastern Regional Meeting on Numbers (SERMON), is tentatively scheduled to be held in April 2018 at East Tennessee State University in Johnson City, Tennessee with local organizer Rodney Keaton.  While ETSU has expressed enthusiasm for hosting the meeting, the meeting location of SERMON is traditionally decided at the previous year's SERMON meeting.  Further information on these meetings including the locations, dates, lists of speakers, lists of participants, and registration information will be linked to the conference home pages as it becomes available.  The conferences slated for 2017 will be the 28th and 29th meetings of the Palmetto Number Theory Series (http://www.math.sc.edu/~boylan/seminars/pantshome.html). PANTS is a series of number theory conferences that was founded in 2006 and is managed jointly by Clemson University and the University of South Carolina, the two flagship research institutions in South Carolina, the Palmetto State. The 31st meeting of the Southeast Regional Meeting on Numbers (http://www.math.clemson.edu/~kevja/SERMON/) will be held in spring 2018.  SERMON is a larger regional meeting founded in 1988; SERMON rotates to schools in a larger geographical region than PANTS. Recent meetings of SERMON have averaged 40 - 60 participants. PANTS and SERMON consist of participant talks on current research in all areas of number theory, including analytic number theory, arithmetic geometry, and automorphic and modular forms. These topics reflect the research interests of number theorists working in the Southeast. Each PANTS meeting features plenary talks by nationally and internationally recognized leaders in the field, invited talks by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and a larger number of contributed talks by mathematicians at all levels including undergraduate and graduate students, and junior and senior faculty.  Number theorists from outside the Southeast will give the invited and plenary talks, while regional researchers will give most of the contributed talks.  SERMON in spring 2018 will feature exclusively contributed talks.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Palmetto Number Theory Series and the Southeastern Regional Meeting on Numbers provide the Southeastern number theory community with a forum to disseminate their own research as well as to learn about new and significant results in number theory.  Students and junior faculty play a prominent role in the meetings both through delivering talks as well as by forming research collaborations to others in the region as well as plenary speakers. Funding from the NSF allows the organizers to achieve their goals at a low cost to individual participants. These meetings integrate regional mathematicians into the community who may have little or no funds for professional travel such as graduate students and faculty at institutions that do not award Ph.Ds. The organizers will continue efforts to attract a demographically diverse participant base including women and racial and ethnic minorities.</AbstractNarration>
