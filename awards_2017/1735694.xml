<AbstractNarration>This project from American University in Washington DC creates an NSF I-Corps Site that will have a close affiliation with the Washington DC I-Corps Node. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tenleytown I-Corps Site for Science and Innovation creates a culture of innovation through student led technology entrepreneurship.  Internal collaborations between the College of Arts and Sciences, the Kogod School of Business and other American University entities as well as external collaborations with the University of the District of Columbia's Community College (UDC-CC) will promote a venture landscape in Washington, DC and beyond.  The College of Arts and Sciences hosts a maker space (STEAMworks) for prototype development and the Kogod School of Business hosts a business incubator.  Each of these assets are now housed in a single interdisciplinary technology building, the Don Myers Technology and Innovation Building, fostering innovative technology ventures. The Tenleytown iCorps Site will open unprecedented technology entrepreneurship training for underrepresented students by sponsoring pitch competitions, customer discovery workshops, and prototype fabrication sessions within the new building. Student teams will join the AU Incubator, perform customer discovery under the Lean Launchpad model, and continue to work within the Innovation Center to prepare for I-Corps regional and national programs, and/or to obtain further funding from innovation competitions, grants, and venture capitalists. The Tenleytown I-Corps Site will (1) develop creative and interdisciplinary ventures with students from a liberal arts university and a community college; (2) develop the innovators' entrepreneurial skills; (3) diversify the profile of venture founders; (4) increase commercialization success of student led technology ventures; (5) prepare students for success in I-Corps regional and national programs; and (6) adequately prepare students and faculty to pursue SBIR/STTR funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tenleytown I-Corps Site's program broader impacts are realized through the creation of a network of strategic partnerships between two diverse institutions and the neighboring technology community. Specifically, each of these institutions have the capacity to increase minority and female representation among business leaders.  Activities will include multi-campus, interdisciplinary collaborations; industry mentorship; participation of 5-10 teams (annually) in the I-Corps Node Program; and an overall culture of change (innovation, entrepreneurship and collaboration) at American University and the University of the District of Columbia Community College.</AbstractNarration>
