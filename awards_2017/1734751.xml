<AbstractNarration>This University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) project builds on an existing I-Corps Site under the University's Innovation Institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. This is a Type II project, requesting a "renewal" of funding for an existing I-Corps Site. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives of the Type II Pitt I-Corps Site include: -Increase the number of entrepreneurial minded individuals on campus through education/training with an emphasis on disciplines and individuals underrepresented in current commercialization offerings -Enhance the Pitt Ventures program through addition of a starter course focused on supplementing viable innovations from campus with key steps required to move them to market -Improve Pitt's connection to the regional entrepreneurial ecosystem for enhanced integration with the local early-stage environment and similar networks beyond Pittsburgh.</AbstractNarration>
