<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the travel expenses of participants in the conference "Applications of Model Theory to Operator Algebras" that will be held from July 31 - August 4, 2017, on the campus of the University of Houston, Houston, Texas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will focus on important recent developments in the use of model theory of operator algebras and the applications of mathematical logic to classification problems in operator algebras. The goals of this conference are to inform non-experts and young researchers of the fundamental concepts of this version of model theory and to update experts who work in other areas of operator algebras of the latest advances. This will be accomplished by a series of five featured lectures by Israel Farah and other plenary research talks presented by a mixture of experienced and junior researchers. The featured lectures will be accessible to all graduate students and non-experts with a basic knowledge of functional analysis and operator algebras. This meeting will provide a special opportunity for early career mathematicians to learn about these recent developments at the interface of logic and set theory and operator algebras. Special attention will be given to ensure the participation of members of underrepresented groups in the conference. The conference will have significant impact on the future of the field of operator algebras and to will broaden and influence the work of junior investigators in this area.</AbstractNarration>
