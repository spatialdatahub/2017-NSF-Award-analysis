<AbstractNarration>Groups appear in numerous areas of mathematics, chemistry and physics and have had tremendous impact as an organizational tool within mathematics. They often appear as the set of symmetries of a geometric object, for example, of 3-dimensional space, a molecule or a crystal. Oftentimes, the set of symmetries themselves, i.e., the group, has a natural topological structure. That is, one can speak of one symmetry being close to another, as in the case of two rotations of 3-dimensional space being close if they differ by a small angle. These latter groups are called topological transformation groups and are trivially related to geometry via the geometric object of which they are the set of symmetries. However, other topological groups are not so easily viewed as coming from geometry. This is, for example, the case for the systems of solutions to many differential equations which form a group under addition called a Banach space. However, one of the principal ideas of the present project is that all topological groups have natural intrinsic geometric structure which is defined jointly by their topological and algebraic structure. Moreover, this geometric structure can in many cases provide significant insight into the structure of the group by blotting out finer details that obscure the global or large scale properties of the group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary aim of this project is to investigate the coarse geometry of topological and, in particular, Polish groups. In earlier research, the PI has established and investigated a natural coarse structure that every topological group is equipped with and which coincides with that traditionally studied on finitely generated or locally compact groups, Banach spaces or even homeomorphism groups of compact manifolds. Particularly interesting subclasses to be studied are the Polish groups of bounded geometry for which the geometric structure theory is well-advanced. Several interesting questions on the extent of this class of groups remain open, for example, whether every Polish group of bounded geometry is coarsely equivalent to a locally compact group. The research program is by nature interdisciplinary. While its origins lie in descriptive set theory, the main examples of groups to be studied arise in various disciplines of mathematics, including functional analysis, logic, and geometric and differential topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
