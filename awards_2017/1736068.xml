<AbstractNarration>Most studies of the effect of drought on freshwater organisms have focused on short, seasonal droughts, while the effects of atypical intense droughts are not well understood. The southeastern United States has recently experienced the most extreme drought in at least 10 years.  Alabama has been particularly hard hit, with nearly 98% of the state being directly affected by drought conditions.  The lack of rainfall during Fall 2016 reduced many streams to trickles while others have completely dried; major rivers reached low levels not seen in over 60 years. Alabama is known as a global biodiversity hotspot for freshwater species of fish, amphibians, and invertebrates. Many of these species are threatened, endangered, and/or found nowhere else on Earth. This study seeks to determine the role of downstream refuges on the effect of intense droughts in aquatic ecosystems with high species diversity. The specific objectives are to: 1) determine changes in species composition in response to intense drought, 2) Identify habitat offering critical refuge from the drought to species with different movement abilities, 3) Build a predictive model of the effects of intense drought and future recovery at local and regional scales. Two graduate students and several undergraduates will be involved in the sampling and research activities of the study. This research will provide management tools to identify and protect Alabama Strategic Habitat Units. The study also will offer summer camps for middle-school students and public outreach activities to citizen science groups organized with collaboration of the Auburn University Museum of Natural History.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will assess the impacts of extreme drought on the dynamics of habitat use as well as evaluate the resilience of aquatic species to flash drought. The investigators hypothesize that the ability to use downstream refuge during drought is a bottleneck that varies based on species vagility and position in the stream network. Stream habitats in two drainages that have experienced the exceptional drought will be sampled and compared to historic, baseline data collected since 2012 to test this hypothesis. The study will predict shifts in distribution patterns of stream fauna in response to flash drought by combining pre-drought survey and environmental DNA (eDNA) data from streams of various sizes in two ecoregions of Alabama, with species-specific vagility potential based on functional trait databases, life history information, and professional judgment. Predicted and observed patterns will be compared using fine scale surveys, broad scale eDNA collections, and spatial analysis. The results of this investigation will provide critical information pertinent to understanding the resiliency of specific taxa and stream communities in general to drought disturbance in a global hotspot for diversity.</AbstractNarration>
