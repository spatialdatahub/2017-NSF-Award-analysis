<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project includes biomedical interventions which harness precise microwave heating patterns from thin needle- and/or catheter-based applicators. Use examples may include image-guided thermal ablation of localized tumors via percutaneous, endoluminal, and endoscopic approaches; localized thermally-mediated drug delivery; and electrosurgical devices for thermal destruction of benign targets. The microwave applicators described in this proposal afford, for the first time, directional control of energy deposition from within thin catheter/needle-based structures. They will enable precise heating of targets in proximity to critical structures, thereby considerably expanding the range of patients that can be treated with low-cost thermal ablation procedures. Furthermore, the proposed microwave applicators may have application to microwave-assisted chemical reactions for materials processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will be focused on customer discovery to identify and understand customer needs in the field of localized microwave heating for biomedical and other applications.  The microwave applicators with directional control of energy deposition have been extensively evaluated with biophysical simulations and benchtop experiments in excised tissue, as well as with preliminary in vivo animal experiments. Proof-of-concept devices have also been integrated with magnetic resonance imaging to demonstrate feasibility for image-guided procedures. This I-Corps project will train the team on identifying potential customers, understanding their needs, and developing technologies to address these needs. This experience will guide the team?s ongoing and future technology developments efforts so they are grounded in practical needs.</AbstractNarration>
