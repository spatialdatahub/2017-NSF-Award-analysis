<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a sensing platform, which is based on tin oxide nanocrystal-reduced graphene oxide (SnO2 NC-RGO) hybrid structures, to fill the need for a low-cost, fast, and ultra-sensitive method for hydrogen (H2) detection. Sensing hydrogen is important because it is very flammable if is mixed with ordinary air (due to the oxygen content in the air). Thus, a sensor is needed in applications requiring or containing hydrogen such as fuel cells, some batteries, hydrogen powered vehicles, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in a prototype handheld device that combines the sensor chip with a digital meter for direct readout of test results; the H2 sensor chip is also adaptable to batteries, fuel cells, and existing air quality monitoring equipment for real-time H2 detection. This NC-RGO sensor chip has the following unique features: rapid response for real-time monitoring, micron-sized dimensions, high sensitivity, scalable fabrication, and wireless communication compatibility. Compared to current hydrogen sensors in the marketplace, these features provide fast response, superior sensitivity/selectivity, portability, low-cost, and facile connection with smart phones/devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  The NC-RGO sensing platform will be further improved in order to realize the low-cost, reliable, ultrasensitive H2 detection for various applications (e.g., H2 fuel cells, vehicles, lead-acid batteries, and air quality monitoring for indoor spaces) associated with H2. Various sensor characteristics will be investigated and validated, including sensor sensitivity, selectivity, long-term stability, performance in different operating conditions (e.g., various humidity values), and calibration methods. Insights into the NC-RGO sensing platform will advance the understanding of the interaction mechanism between gas molecules and low-dimensional materials in hybrid structures. Such understanding can further contribute to the design of nanomaterials with desirable properties to identify active sites and rates of catalytic reactions on metal/metal oxide NCs and to provide guidelines for performance enhancement through engineering properties of NCs. In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduates (including underrepresented students) and graduate students, will receive innovation and entrepreneurship training experiences through interacting with industrial partners and additional entrepreneurship training through I-Corps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages NanoAffix Science LLC., Johnson Controls, and A.O. Smith to augment the project impact through accelerated commercialization of the resulting H2 sensing technology.</AbstractNarration>
