<AbstractNarration>The ModEL-C project will examine how cognitive load affects students' conceptual learning through the use of chemistry and biochemistry models.  The disciplines of chemistry and biochemistry present a particular challenge to students with abstract concepts that can lead to rampant and resistant misconceptions, affecting both learning and student retention.  Based on the data collected from this study, the project team will implement three-dimensional (3D) virtual and physical modeling activities across the chemistry and biochemistry curriculum that optimize cognitive load and thereby enhance student learning.   Ultimately this work will create better consumers of chemistry and biochemistry education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will characterize the cognitive load of 3D physical and virtual modeling activities by defining what and how many cognitive tasks and concepts are accessed while using those 3D modeling activities in general, organic and biochemistry courses. To this end, a student cohort and select content experts will participate in a simulated learning environment, completing modeling activities while their cognition is monitored by means of eye-tracking and electroencephalogram (EEG) technologies.  Moving forward, this project will provide evidence to more intelligently design and execute 3D virtual and physical modeling activities to decrease their cognitive load en route to deepening students' ability to understand biomolecular interactions and overcome misconceptions.  This evidence will create avenues for curricular change, from minimal to drastic, for those researchers and practitioners interested in conceptual changes as well as the advancement of the NGSS practice of modeling.</AbstractNarration>
