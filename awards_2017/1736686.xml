<AbstractNarration>Because of the enormous capacity of the world?s oceans to absorb, store, and release heat and carbon, it is critically important to study the role of the oceans in global climate change and in the global carbon cycle. The Indo-Pacific warm pool (IPWP) is the largest mass of very warm surface ocean temperatures (&amp;#8805;28&amp;#730;C) of the world?s oceans and the biggest source of energy and moisture to the atmosphere; as such, it is intimately linked to atmospheric circulation, rainfall patterns, and global climate. Beneath the surface ocean is the deep Pacific, which is the largest basin of the world?s ocean with enormous capacity to store carbon and heat. Thus, it plays a critical role in the carbon cycle, in heat transport, and in global climate change. Although it is clear from studies of modern conditions that the IPWP and the deep Pacific are crucial components of the climate system, there is a lot that is not understood about how these regions respond to, and participate in, long term global climate change especially in a warming world.  To probe these topics, this project is focused on past geological epochs when global climate was dramatically different than today. This project will involve a post-doctoral scholar and at least ten undergraduates at UCSC, thereby providing critical training and mentoring for an early career scientist and for undergraduates seeking training in STEM fields. There will be special attention placed on undergraduates being involved in original research and in recruiting a diverse team of researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate the early Pliocene warm period and the transition to the cold Ice Age climate of the Pleistocene. This time interval (6 ? 0 million years ago) provides valuable tests of our understanding of the behavior of the climate during warm periods and during major long-term climate transitions. To this end, from Oct. 6 to Dec. 8, 2016, the International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 363 (IODP Exp 363) recovered ~7 km of sediment from nine sites in the IPWP region. As part of an international collaborative effort with other IODP Exp 363 shipboard scientists, this project will achieve two of the primary objectives of IODP Exp 363. First, to test the null hypothesis that the IPWP was stable even while there were major changes in global climate, planktonic foraminifera surface and subsurface Mg/Ca-temperature estimates covering the last 6 myrs at several IPWP sites (U1482/3 and U1488) will be generated. Comparison between these sites, and comparison to other temperature proxy measurements will be critical for evaluating proxy biases, the role of the thermocline, and the influence of the Indo-Pacific Throughflow, on the evolution of the IPWP. Second, to test the idea that there was North Pacific deep water formation in the latest Miocene and warm Pliocene period, benthic foraminifera isotope records at two West Pacific sites (U1488 and U1489) will be generated. Comparison to published benthic isotope data from elsewhere in the Pacific, and to modeling simulations, will put these new measurements into a global context. These data will also be critical to the development of high-resolution age models, providing a key framework for other researchers working on the cores. Overall, the results of this project will be combined with data being generated by other Expedition 363 scientists, and with ocean and climate modelers, in order to achieve a deeper mechanistic understanding of the role of the Indo-Pacific region in global climate processes. In addition, it will determine if North Pacific deep water formed and contributed to global heat transport during past periods of warmth.</AbstractNarration>
