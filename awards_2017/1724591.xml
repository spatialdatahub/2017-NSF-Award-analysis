<AbstractNarration>This award supports 40 graduate and undergraduate students studying at US institutions to participate in the  2017 PowderMET sponsored by the Metal Powder Industries Federation. This premier powder metallurgy conference acts as a bridges between industries, government laboratories, and academic institutions. The award provides student participants with opportunities to exchange ideas with leading researchers and engineers from worldwide industrial and governmental facilities, as well as with students and faculty from both domestic and international schools. In addition to nurturing a powder metallurgy community, participants will learn the latest research areas and results in powder metallurgy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides the student participants with opportunities to exchange ideas with leading researchers and engineers from worldwide industrial and governmental facilities, as well as with students and faculty from both domestic and international universities. In addition to nurturing a global powder metallurgy (traditional press &amp; sinter, metal injection molding, isostatic pressing, and metal additive manufacturing) vision, participants will learn the latest research areas and results in the fields of interest. These opportunities will not only improve the participants' knowledge in the field but also develop scientists and engineers who are ideally suited to craft the next generation of designs in powder metallurgy that will push the nation's manufacturing capabilities.</AbstractNarration>
