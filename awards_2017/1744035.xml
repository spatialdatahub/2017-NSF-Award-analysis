<AbstractNarration>The conference "Dynamics Days 2018" will take place in Denver, Colorado in January 4-6, 2018. Dynamics Days is an international conference focused on chaos, nonlinear dynamics, and their applications. This award provides funds to defray travel costs for graduate and undergraduate students and postdocs without other sources of support. This year the conference will showcase research in areas including networks, fluid dynamics, mixing, topological time series analysis, nonlinear waves, dynamic mode decomposition, and biological systems. The conference will have 15 invited speakers, a similar number of contributed speakers, and poster sessions. The conference webpage is http://www.colorado.edu/amath/ddays-2018/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamics Days is an international conference on applications of nonlinear dynamics and chaos which has been running in the US for 35 years. During this time, it has established itself as one of the main venues for the discussion of new ideas in nonlinear dynamics. The conference is characterized by covering a wide area of applications, which promotes the exchange of ideas and dissemination of results across different fields. The variety of topics attracts participants with diverse backgrounds, including physics, mathematics, engineering, and biology. Travel awards will be offered to graduate and undergraduate students and postdocs without other sources of support. These participants will be able to present their results in contributed talks or poster sessions, and will gain a broad perspective of interdisciplinary research in the field. The participation of underrepresented groups will be encouraged.</AbstractNarration>
