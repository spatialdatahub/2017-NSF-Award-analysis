<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the commercialization of more sustainable catalysts for emission control systems. The use of high levels of pure noble metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium in existing commercial catalysts are increasingly unsustainable in many aspects, including high price, noble metal scarcity, low recycling recovery, and limited global supply, posing significant challenges to catalyst manufacturing. Manufacturing low-cost and efficient catalysts for commercial applications in emission control systems will enable more cost effective adherence to clean air and other environmental regulations. The low-noble metal content catalysts are anticipated to reduce the content of noble metals in the catalysts in comparison with existing catalysts in many emission control systems, reducing the cost of emission control systems.  There is a clear market potential for the catalyst technology in view of the expectation of the global market of emission control system catalysts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project focuses on customer discovery in the translation of a new catalyst technology to commercial production of low-noble-metal-content catalysts for emission control systems.  Noble metals such as palladium and platinum are widely used in the catalysts for emission control systems, including factory exhaust gas treatment reactors and catalytic converters, to meet the ever-tightening of emission standards, calling for further reduction of emission levels of the criteria gaseous pollutants.  However, the high costs and market volatility risks associated with the platinum group metals constitute a major area of pain in the market of emission control systems.  To address this challenge, the proposed low-noble-metal-content catalysts feature noble metals alloyed with non-noble transition metals in nano-alloy and composite formulations, which exhibit enhanced catalytic activity and stability for the elimination reactions of the pollutants at significantly reduced use of noble metals in comparison with existing catalysts in the commercial emission control systems.  Insights into the competitiveness of the catalyst technology in the emission control catalyst market will be developed through the intensified activities of customer discovery in this project.</AbstractNarration>
