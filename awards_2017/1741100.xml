<AbstractNarration>Graphene-based composites (combinations of graphene and nanoparticles) are being adopted for versatile applications in field-effect transistors, sensors, supercapacitors, solar cells, Li-ion batteries, photocatalysts, and photoconductors. However, the performance of graphene composites is often plagued by the highly disordered microstructure, aggregation of nanoparticles, and loosely connected interfaces between graphene and nanoparticles.  This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project seeks to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of enhanced electrochemical properties of graphene/silicon nanocomposites in their battery application through controlled laser processing. The laser assisted synthetic study will be complemented by theoretical modeling that seeks to predict the observed behavior. The educational activities associated with this project focus on hands-on outreach activities for middle school students on battery technology, coordinated through the Women in Engineering program at Purdue University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this research is to manufacture graphene/silicon nanocomposites by laser processing and understand the electrochemical behavior through atomistic modeling and electrochemical tests. Laser processed graphene/silicon nanoparticles display advantages in mechanical stability, material uniformity, and low contact resistance at graphene/nanoparticle interfaces. To develop a fundamental understanding of laser processing and the resulting properties, the research plan has two major objectives. The first objective is to study the interfacial engineering of laser processed nanocomposites through experiments and modeling. The second objective is to understand the electrochemical behaviors of graphene/silicon nanocomposites by performance tests, such as charging/discharging cycle stability and rate performance. The research will determine the optimum processing conditions for the enhanced electrochemical performance of graphene/silicon nanocomposite. The knowledge gained from this work will facilitate the manufacture of graphene based nanocomposites and contribute to the development of energy-storage materials.</AbstractNarration>
