<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase treatment options and to improve health outcomes for patients using a comprehensive algorithm-based behavior health intervention. It can address Institute of Health Improvement's Triple AIM to improve population health, improve patients' experience of care, and reduce per capita healthcare cost. The proposed platform is aimed at optimizing treatment outcomes by enhancing motivations, maximizing treatment adherence, engaging families and natural supports, and supporting self-care management for individuals with chronic/serious behavioral health conditions. The proposed technology is expected to enable patients to receive an ancillary, active treatment that keeps them functioning in daily life. By enhancing the clinical experience for patients and clinicians, individuals with behavioral health conditions can self-monitor and communicate their experiences to their clinician and record them in real time, allowing monitoring and assessment by the behavioral health provider.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop and test a novel behavior health technology intervention on improving patients? ability to feel in control of their treatment and improve their well-being.  The technology is expected to enable ongoing, real-time feedback to the both the patient's personal and professional care team to monitor the impact of enabling/impending factors on treatment progress to continually refine the care plan and interventions so that optimal results can be achieved. The platform consists of a secure mobile and web platform used to provide proactive interventions, advanced algorithms used to personalize care and provide insights to the behavioral health provider. The team plans to assess whether the combination of personal support effectively in the patients' care together with advanced correlations using deep learning can help in predicting interventions including crisis episode, improve patient's treatment planning and wellness.</AbstractNarration>
