<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Rowan University funds student development and the advancement of interdisciplinary biomedical engineering and science research focusing on biomedical materials, devices, therapeutics, and emerging frontiers. The Site will provide opportunities for ten, diverse undergraduate participants each summer to conduct novel, cutting-edge research under the direction of faculty mentors from three colleges - the Henry M. Rowan College of Engineering, the College of Science and Mathematics, and Rowan's Cooper School of Medicine - and eight academic departments, with the Department of Biomedical Engineering as the lead. Students will participate as a group in weekly seminars and workshops that provide comprehensive professional development and allow cross-cultivation of the individual research experience. This REU Site will advance the field and prepare students for future advanced careers in engineering and science relevant to medicine and healthcare and provide a holistic experience for development of strong research skills. Enhancing or improving quality of life and health benefits society and is a cross-cutting theme in the National Academy of Engineering's Grand Challenges for Engineering in the 21st Century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this REU Site is to provide undergraduates an exciting research experience that will prepare and motivate them for further education and careers in science and engineering as well as advance and support novel biomedical engineering and science research. The REU Site cohort will be a diverse group of undergraduate participants from four-year institutions and community colleges that have limited opportunity to engage in research activities. This REU site will be beneficial to the students' appreciation of interconnected and multi-disciplinary topics within the fields of science and engineering, understanding of related concepts between inter-related disciplines, presentation and problem solving skills, appreciation for life-long learning, and desire to pursue advanced studies and careers in science and engineering. Research projects will advance the field and be interdisciplinary in nature and will include biomaterials and tissue engineering, micro/nano systems and device development, regenerative medicine, biomolecule detection, medication development and evaluation, nanoparticle synthesis and development, and personalized medicine. Undergraduate and graduate student mentors from Rowan University will participate in the program and provide peer contacts.</AbstractNarration>
