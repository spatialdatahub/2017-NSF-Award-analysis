<AbstractNarration>Seven Worlds is a landmark television series and multi-media project from BBC America and the BBC Natural History Unit, due to broadcast in 2019/2020.  In addition to the large U.S. and global reach of the television series, this project promises to have the largest online footprint of any BBC wildlife series to date. This award is for logistic support only for filming marine life with NSF-supported research programs at McMurdo Station, Antarctica during the 2017/2018 polar season. Seven Worlds will engage, inform, and inspire audiences with iconic landscapes, spectacular wildlife, and cutting-edge science. The series will look at the natural history unique to each of the seven continents, and explore how their geographic position and geologic history have influenced the wildlife living there. A key episode is on Antarctica. It will provide an unparalleled opportunity to see how earth system processes and ecosystem dynamics have shaped the extraordinary physical and behavioral adaptions of life forms that manage to survive the extreme cold. It will also  showcase scientific discoveries about the world's toughest environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This series will reflect the newest iteration of storytelling methods to promote audience engagement and learning of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) content. The BBC Natural History Unit's expertise in emotive and factual storytelling will inform the content and narrative of the deliverables. This allows for a scientifically accurate yet captivating viewer experience that enhances retention of scientific information.  In addition, the television series will be complemented with a series of short-form out-reach videos with collaborating scientists to showcase their important work online.  BBC landmark wildlife series attract a gender-balanced group of viewers, reach a younger audience, and reach a more diverse audience when compared to other factual programs. With BBC's sizable audience and ability to reach traditionally underserved demographics, the project will promote STEM research to a broad and diverse audience.  The intent is to create a platform that not only helps the public understand Antarctic science, but to feel immersed and connected to a place that is distant and remote.  Often what is "out of sight is out of mind", but by transporting the public to a place few will ever visit, this film and associated online components will make tangible concepts such as: Antarctic biodiversity, behavioral ecology, biogeography, geomorphology, glaciology, and humanity's role in shaping the future. The project is supported by NSF's Office of Polar Programs.</AbstractNarration>
