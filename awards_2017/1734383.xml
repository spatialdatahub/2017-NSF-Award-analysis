<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to use focused laser light as a method for powering and remotely controlling millimeter-sized manufacturing microrobots suitable for fabricating and assembling even smaller devices. Swarms of multi-legged, light-driven microrobots, capable of operation in either dry or wet environments, will be built and studied. This project will pave the way for the microfactories of the future, enabling the production of nanopositioning and nanotransport devices with applications to nanomanufacturing and biotechnology. Microrobots have long been envisioned as a gateway for full human telepresence at the micro- and nanoscales, where conventional tools cannot be used for manipulation or assembly. Potential outcomes of this project include unprecedented manufacturing capabilities in nano- and biotechnology, leading to new opportunities for US industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this project is to study novel and efficient light-based wireless energy transfer and control methods for collectives of microrobots that can accomplish precision nano-scale positioning and manipulation tasks. The project will provide fundamental new knowledge for programming multi-actuator locomotors with a single light source, using differential responses of the robot limbs to generate multi-legged gaits. The project will create new photo-thermo-dynamic robot models, and new learning control algorithms suitable for physical inter-robot cooperation. To validate the models and control schemes, a unique hardware infrastructure will be prototyped and experimentally demonstrated to drive and test two types of light-powered microrobots. The first type of light-powered microrobot, called "Micro-laser-hopper," is an untethered microrobot with flexure legs that can accomplish controlled stick-slip crawling over a dry surface using a single, large diameter laser beam source. Micro-laser-hopper gait is controlled by changing temporal laser parameters, such as intensity, pulse frequency and duty cycle. The second type of light-powered microrobot, called "Micro-solar-one," is an integrated microrobot containing a solar cell, in-plane microactuators, microassembled legs, and a vertical electronic backpack. Micro-solar-one is powered by concentrated, broad spectrum white light, and is able to store and execute complex gaits, at the expense of more complex manufacturing and thermal management challenges.</AbstractNarration>
