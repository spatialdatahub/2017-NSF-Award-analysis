<AbstractNarration>This project, from Georgia Tech, establishes an I-Corps Site in conjunction with their Venture Lab. The Site targets faculty, graduate students and post-doc researchers and collaborates with the I-Corps South Node to deliver entrepreneurship education to faculty, students and researchers. The Site provides catalytic funding to thirty research startup teams per year for customer discovery and minimum viable product (MVP) development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In both the near- and long-term, the Georgia Tech Site's actions of increasing the number of teams participating in the national I-Corps program and increasing commercialization and the translation of research will deliver the fundamental intent of the NSF Sites Program and broaden the impact of commercialization in the region.</AbstractNarration>
