<AbstractNarration>Challenges to maintaining high water quality in Maine lakes include predicting the responses of lake ecosystems to variations and the extent of engagement of residents in lake stewardship activities. The long-term goal of this research project is to advance a fundamental understanding of processes that control the susceptibility of lakes to environmental factors.  Citizen scientists are being trained to collect the data that projects researchers are using to characterize the environmental characteristics of the local environment.  The cross-disciplinary approach to the research project, especially with respect to stakeholder engagement in implementing best management practices, can act as a model for other states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to engage citizen scientists to collect water and sediment samples from 25 Maine lakes simultaneously several times during the summer season across a continuum of oligotrophic to eutrophic lakes. The synthesis of data allows the project researchers to formulate a scientific basis for the changes in lake water quality and to develop a predictive model for the epilimnetic phosphorus concentrations.   Through workshops and pre- and post-project surveys with citizen scientists and lake residents, the researchers are articulating processes by which changes to lake water quality are influenced by natural and anthropogenic factors and identifying cognitive and behavioral factors that affect the human system. The project researchers are training citizen scientists in proper sample collection practice and developing surveys to assess lake stewardship activities and engagement.   Afterwards, the researchers are implementing lake stewardship workshops to share the project findings. The development of the predictive lake phosphorus model involving lake stakeholders will advance knowledge within the field of limnology and will allow the development of an adaptive management process whereby the interaction between the social and biophysical components are enhanced.</AbstractNarration>
