<AbstractNarration>DCL; HBCU EAGER: Structural and functional characterization of proteins associated with silver nanoparticle resistant Escherichia coli&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, integration of electrospun nanofibers in commercial products has been growing exponentially. Electrospun nanofibers have been found in a number of applications such as air filtration, liquid filtration, performance apparel, drug delivery, scaffold for tissue engineering, battery separators and etc. The electrospun nanofibers are already exposed (and will continue being exposed) to our environment through corresponding commercial products in the form of nano fibrous mat. Inevitably, they will be in contact with microorganisms in environment, including fungi.  However, little is known about biological interaction between electrospun nanofibrous mat and fungal cells. Detailed interaction information between fungal cells and electrospun nanofibrous mat from this research project will create public awareness about electrospun nanofibers' uses and their impact on environmental microorganism. Policy makers can also make use of the information to regulate the integration of electrospun nanofibers in consumer products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to explore viability and growth behavior of a model fungal cell (yeast) on electrospun polyacrylonitrile nano fibrous mat (as well as other electrospun nano fibrous mats) by cell morphology, cell number, and cell metabolic activity. The results will be compared with those from microfibrous and film counterparts. The project will provide new knowledge regarding interaction between fungal cells and electrospun nanofibrous materials by investigating the effect of chemical structure, size, surface roughness, hierarchical structure of the electrospun nanofibrous mats. The research outcomes can aid in understanding the mechanism of the biological interaction and disclose a brand-new way to realize antifungal functionality by simple physical contact without integrating any antifungal drugs or functional groups. The acquired knowledge will fill in a largely unknown research field and further translate to other nano materials that have similar structure, dimension, and/or morphology as electrospun nanofibrous materials.</AbstractNarration>
