<AbstractNarration>An award is made to the Department of Biological Sciences at Minnesota State University Mankato (MSU), a primarily undergraduate institution, to acquire a Zeiss LSM880 with Airyscan Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope. The confocal microscope will immediately enhance MSU's motivated and well-trained faculty to conduct cutting edge research and train undergraduate and masters students in qualitative and quantitative fluorescent imaging. Additionally, the confocal microscope acquisition boosts MSU?s ability to recruit top-notch new faculty while facilitating current faculty's capacity to conduct transformative research, obtain grant funding, and publish results in high-quality journals. Importantly, it provides undergraduate and graduate students direct exposure to state-of-the-art confocal imaging technology necessary for future careers in the biological sciences through independent research projects and in-class utilization. Lastly, the confocal microscope will strengthen STEM/STEAM outreach activities of underrepresented groups through collaboration with already in-place college supported programs that aim to promote access to and interest in STEM for underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquired confocal microscope augments a wide range of research projects associated with several sciences disciplines, including biology, chemistry, and geology, by eliminating the limits imposed by conventional light microscopes on imaging and analysis. The confocal microscope strengthens the research programs of at least 13 investigators (PI, CoPI, 6 major users, and 5 auxiliary users) by elevating research projects that investigate tissue architecture, biochemical and cellular interactions, developmental biology, neurobiology, endocrinology, microbiology, plant science, and geology. Investigator projects' will utilize the full range of the confocal microscope's capabilities including high-resolution multi-label imaging, 3D reconstruction, live-imaging, and spectral unmixing. These projects span a multitude of model systems including rodents (mice), cell cultures lines, Anolis carolinensis (green anoles), Dictyostelium discoideum (slime mold), plant tissues, microorganisms, and sediments. The acquired confocal microscope is anticipated to not only meet the needs of current faculty, but also have the ability to meet the future needs of the department and university.</AbstractNarration>
