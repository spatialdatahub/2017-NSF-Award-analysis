<AbstractNarration>This proposal is for support of travel to ICDCS, which is a premier conference and has a wide coverage of topics in distributed computing.  Selected papers have influenced the design and implementation of many distributed computing systems, software and applications in use today. The conference continues to evolve in terms of the number of paper submissions and in the quality of accepted papers.  The number of submissions has consistently increased. In addition, the conference also accepted another 40 presentations in the tracks of Industry, Applications, and Visions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference, to be held in Atlanta, USA, June 5-8, 2017, will span four days and will consist of technical paper presentations, panels, presentations, and workshops. It will also feature keynote speeches from leading researchers and practitioners in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student travel to conferences is an important activity. Funds will be dispersed with preference given to students who would not otherwise be able to attend the conference and students who are not already scheduled to present a paper, paying particular attention to diversity and relevance of the student's research interest.</AbstractNarration>
