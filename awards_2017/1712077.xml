<AbstractNarration>Currently, no platform exists for the budding community of environmental seismology to meet and exchange ideas and research products. This conference will take advantage of the gathering of international expertise to identify key needs for continued growth and innovation, initiate development of an international community structure to facilitate sharing of data and methods, and discuss potential community experiments where outstanding multidisciplinary observations will enable benchmarking of emerging methods in environmental seismology. More than half of the supported participants will be early career scientists who are likely to have a stake in the nascent international research community in environmental seismology. Applications for U.S. participant support will be sought from scientists rooted in a variety of disciplines and specifically encourage applications from underrepresented minorities engaged in environmental seismology research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An EGU Galileo Conference is planned for June 2017 to survey the state of art of environmental seismology, share new analysis techniques, and discuss specific needs for further advancing near-surface applications of seismology. The conference will provide a starting point to create community structures and define shared approaches. A specific goal is to use the gathering of global experts to collectively identify opportunities for obtaining benchmark data where both seismological and traditional geomorphic observations can be or have been obtained with high data quality. This project will support participation of 7 U.S. scientists in the conference. Enabling U.S. participation in the conference will highlight recent and ongoing domestic research in environmental seismology and give U.S. scientists a voice in discussions of future research directions and international community development.</AbstractNarration>
