<AbstractNarration>The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), created in 1990 under President George H.W. Bush, is an independent advisory committee. Comprised of approximately 20 civilian members with diverse backgrounds in academic research, industry, and military service,  PCAST was co-chaired by the president's science advisor.    PCAST provided advice related to science, technology, and innovation: jobs and economic growth, public health, national and domestic security, energy and the environment, STEM education, emerging technologies and research, and other specialized topics of value to the president and provides timely recommendations to address urgent public policy challenges. PCAST played a critical role in the development of federal  research initiatives and reviewed large-scale government science and technology programs and ensured the president had the most up-to-date scientific and technical information to make policy decisions.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;While always having the same goal during each Presidential administration, the membership, operation, activities, and impact of PCAST changed, reflecting the needs of the administration's highest priority policy issues. This science policy research report examines the role and influence of PCAST over the last four administrations of Presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. The project compiles a database of the demographics of PCAST members including their gender, ethnicity, areas of expertise, and career background.  Review activities of PCAST including reports, meetings, and newsworthy events are analyzed to assess PCAST's impact on science and technology policy and decision-making, with suggestions for best practices and actionable recommendations to improve PCAST in the current and future administrations.</AbstractNarration>
