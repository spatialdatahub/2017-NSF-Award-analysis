<AbstractNarration>Clemson University is broadening participation in computing in South Carolina by preparing computer science (CS) teachers to effectively use culturally responsive, inclusive pedagogies. The South Carolina Department of Education (SCDE) has just launched K-8 Standards that aim to engage all students in computer science and computational thinking and create a pipeline for high school courses.  These inaugural standards present a significant need for qualified teachers and the knowledge to prepare them. This proposal would develop an active community of high school CS teachers and researchers ahead of this demand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project leverages an existing Researcher-Practitioner Partnership (RPP), including computer science and education researchers, along with administrators and teacher practitioners from the Anderson Five Career Campus (which will offer computing courses to high school students in Anderson School Districts), Pickens County School District, and South Carolina's Coalition for Mathematics and Science (an organization providing professional develoment to additional districts). Many of the participating schools have significant underrepresented and/or economically disadvantaged student populations. The project will investigate the effectiveness of different models of teacher support (including just-in-time, online only, versus a mixture of online and offline) on Pedagogical Content Knowledge for Computer Science, self-efficacy, and teacher understanding and implementation of culturally responsive computing, and teacher belief that all students are capable of digital innovation. There has been strong coordination between project activities and policy that is being adopted by the SCDE, which could serve as a model for partnerships in other states.</AbstractNarration>
