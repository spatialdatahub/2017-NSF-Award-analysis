    <AbstractNarration>The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on R/V Atlantis, a 274' general purpose Global vessel operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The vessel is owned by the U.S. Navy, has state-of-the-art instrumentation and supports all disciplines of oceanographic research. The Global vessel and can accommodate a scientific party of up to 32 persons for as many as 60 days. The vessel works in all the world's oceans supporting science funded primarily by U.S government agencies. R/V Atlantis is specifically outfitted for launching and servicing Alvin, the human occupied submersible as well as other vehicles of the National Deep Submergence Facility (NDSF). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2016, R/V Atlantis completed 279 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 60% of the total sailing schedule (167 days). In 2017, Atlantis is scheduled for 300 days with NSF accounting for 231 of those or 73%. R/V Armstrong is scheduled for 237 days, 30% of which (72 days) are for NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) -80C Ultra-Low Upright Freezer $8,320&lt;br/&gt;2) Ultra-low Chest Freezer (2 ea) $11,160&lt;br/&gt; $19,480</AbstractNarration>
