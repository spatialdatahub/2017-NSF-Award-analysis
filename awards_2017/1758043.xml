<AbstractNarration>Most large web applications are built using distributed databases.                                  &lt;br/&gt;This project tackles a fundamental question: as these applications                                  &lt;br/&gt;grow, leading to more query and update processing, can we scale                                    &lt;br/&gt;application performance without requiring a massive reprogramming                                  &lt;br/&gt;effort.  The premise of this project is that today's two leading database                          &lt;br/&gt;paradigms -- ACID and BASE -- are profoundly unsatisfying. ACID implementations                      &lt;br/&gt;provide strong properties that make it easy to develop an application                              &lt;br/&gt;and reason about its correctness, but they struggle to keep up in                                  &lt;br/&gt;performance and availability as the volume of accesses to the database                              &lt;br/&gt;grows; and while the BASE programming paradigm can meet these needs,                                &lt;br/&gt;the price is to give up all ACID guarantees, drastically increasing                                &lt;br/&gt;both development time and the possibility of introducing bugs.  This                                &lt;br/&gt;project aims to develop the new theoretical framework necessary to                                  &lt;br/&gt;overcome this impasse and simultaneously support consistency, availability,                        &lt;br/&gt;and scalability; and to build a database prototype that implements the                              &lt;br/&gt;mechanisms necessary to support this new framework.                                                &lt;br/&gt;                                                                                                    &lt;br/&gt;The project introduces a new programming framework that combines the ease                          &lt;br/&gt;of ACID transactions with the performance of a BASE implementation                                  &lt;br/&gt;by introducing a new abstraction, BASE transactions. The                                            &lt;br/&gt;syntax and semantics of BASE transactions are driven by two                                        &lt;br/&gt;goals. First, BASE transactions should achieve high performance and                                &lt;br/&gt;availability by loosening the overly-tight coupling between atomicity                              &lt;br/&gt;and isolation of the ACID paradigm, while nonetheless retaining its                                &lt;br/&gt;ability to express and enforce the atomicity requirements motivated by                              &lt;br/&gt;a given applications semantics. Second, it should be possible to                                  &lt;br/&gt;surgically transform performance-critical ACID transactions into BASE                              &lt;br/&gt;transactions without affecting either the correctness or the                                        &lt;br/&gt;performance of the unmodified ACID transactions.                                                    &lt;br/&gt;                                                                                                    &lt;br/&gt;To demonstrate this new programing framework, this project will develop                            &lt;br/&gt;Salt, a database that combines the desirable qualities of both ACID and BASE                        &lt;br/&gt;paradigms.  The project will apply this work to Health Care IT through a partnership                &lt;br/&gt;with a 501(c)(3) entity in central Texas charged with providing health information                  &lt;br/&gt;technology solutions to local health care infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
