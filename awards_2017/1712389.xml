<AbstractNarration>Connecting topics, experiments and methods in physics and engineering through the modernization of the advanced laboratory curriculum plays a significant role in motivating student interest and addressing the national needs in the STEM workplace. Our current workforce environment is one of unprecedented challenges and opportunities, demanding innovation and leadership skills. Current STEM students must be forward thinking and community orientated in order to solve grand challenges and take advantages of diverse opportunities. This Chicago State University (CSU) project focuses on building on traditional perspectives to include modern perspectives to address science and engineering applications to inspire students who can address local and global challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will lead to a complete modernization of the advanced laboratory curriculum for physics and engineering students. The project will have outcomes that include: 1) Outlining a curriculum plan for the modernization CSU's applied physics/engineering laboratory with the inclusion of modern equipment, applications, and new experimental Learning Lab modules, 2) Establishing a student learning community that will inform instructional revisions by incorporating student input through the use the Learning Assistant Program, and 3) Providing outreach opportunities for increasing STEM interest by utilizing the student-developed modules at local high schools. In the first phase of the project, we will design modules that will include interactive technology, modern research techniques, assessment materials, and lesson plans leveraging  student input through focus groups and expert input from an external advisory board consisting of university faculty and industry representatives. The second phase of the program will focus on assessing the effectiveness of this curriculum and dissemination of the project to diverse institutions. Specifically, the project will add to the small but growing body of research on how a modernization of the advanced lab curriculum can enhance student communication skills, experimental analysis skills, content understanding, and attitudes and expectations toward experiments and experimentation.</AbstractNarration>
