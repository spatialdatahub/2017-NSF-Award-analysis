<AbstractNarration>CBET 1724659 - Keith, David &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is in partial support of the 2017 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on  Geoengineering to be held on July 23-28, 2017 at Sunday River in Newry, ME. The funds will partially cover registration and travel costs for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and/or early career investigators. The GRC will focus on the scientific questions associated with geoengineering, with the goal of fostering a better understanding of its efficacy and risks, particularly among young researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has been an increase in publications on solar geoengineering, which speaks to the number of researchers active in this field. Yet, despite this rapid rise in publications, there is no established periodic scientific meeting in this emerging field. As one of the world's best and most established meeting formats in the physical sciences, the GRC provides an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate the quality and frequency of scientific discourse on this topic. This both means that existing disciplinary conferences are inadequate for building the necessary cross-disciplinary collaborations, and that the GRC format with emphasis on in-depth discussions is ideal for promoting these. The geoengineering field is also young, with many unanswered scientific questions. This meeting will be a unique opportunity for both early and senior career researchers. This first GRC on solar geoengineering will help create new opportunities for early and senior career researchers to learn about the latest scientific findings, advance their own work, and possibly collaborate on new projects together.</AbstractNarration>
