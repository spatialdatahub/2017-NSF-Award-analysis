<AbstractNarration>The light of all stars, galaxies, and accreting black holes in the observable Universe is encoded in the extragalactic background light (EBL), which is critically important to understand galaxy evolution and stellar activity, but as of today it remains still highly uncertain.  This project will provide the first measurements of the intensity and evolution of the UV-optical component of the EBL from the present age to the time when the Universe was only 1.5 billion years old.  The measurements provided by this project will be used to estimate the luminosity density of galaxies, quantify the extent of the population of ultra-faint galaxies, and measure the fraction of photons that escape absorption within the host galaxy and how that changes with redshift and wavelength.  This project will foster the partnership with historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to increase the number of African Americans that are awarded an MS in physics and support a graduate student who will complete his PhD with this award.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Gamma-ray photons emitted from distant sources can be absorbed in the interaction with photons of the EBL, thus providing an indirect tool to quantify the intensity of the EBL as a function of redshift.  This project will rely on all known gamma-ray sources to measure the intensity of the optical-UV component of the EBL, for the first time, up to a redshift of 4.  These measurements will allow the PI and his team to constrain the luminosity density of galaxies and investigate whether galaxies are responsible for the re-ionization of the Universe.</AbstractNarration>
