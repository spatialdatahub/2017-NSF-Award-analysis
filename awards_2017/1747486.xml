<AbstractNarration>This award will support the organization of a two-day workshop on future challenges in language science, with integrated discussion of science communication (making language science research accessible to specialist peers, scientists in other fields, and the general public). The workshop will take place in Madison, WI, immediately following the 2018 Cognitive Science Society annual meeting. Language science is an interdisciplinary area drawing on theories and methods from linguistics, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, and artificial intelligence, among other fields. The primary goal is basic scientific understanding of the human capacity for language and potential longer-term impact on technology, education, and health.Â &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invited speakers will 1) provide critical reviews of different theoretical perspectives, methodological approaches, and tools (such as eye tracking, electroencephalography, or functional magnetic resonance imaging); 2) focus on near- and long-term challenges facing language science; or 3) focus on science communication and education. In an effort to spark discussion and collaboration,  research interest groups will be formed that will hold videoconference meetings in Fall, 2018. Plans include strategies for promoting student participation and inclusion of women and members of under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
