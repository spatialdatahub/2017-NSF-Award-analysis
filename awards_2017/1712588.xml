<AbstractNarration>Scientists at the University of Washington's (UW) Polar Science Center and science educators at Pacific Science Center in Seattle, WA will collaborate to create polar science planetarium shows using the new Digitalis projection system in Pacific Science Center's Willard Smith Planetarium. The polar shows will be presented daily at the planetarium, for a total of 700 showings over the course of this project. Polar scientists and graduate students will participate in a course designed to teach skills in public communication of science and then will participate in a smaller number of live presentations of the planetarium shows. Selected polar shows will also be "Domecast" to other planetariums around the country. Researchers will contribute to the study of cognition in the affective realm, looking specifically at how choices made in the presentation style, image selection and content can result in emotional engagement of the viewer and increased interest in the content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The content for the shows will consist of two parts: (1) general material about the polar regions, made suitable for elementary school children in grades 3-5, and (2) material derived from active research projects, made suitable for general audiences. The proposed activities are meant to inspire greater interest, appreciation, and enjoyment of science; stimulate students to consider careers in STEM fields; inform the public about NSF's contribution to polar science; impart an awareness of the Earth's polar-regions and their role in global climate; and increase participating scientists' comfort and ability to communicate with public audiences. Evaluations will determine the impact of these planetarium shows on the engagement of the public with the polar sciences.</AbstractNarration>
