<AbstractNarration>This award will support student attendance at the 32nd Annual Computational Complexity Conference (CCC), in Riga, Latvia, July 6 to 9, 2017.&lt;br/&gt;The field of computational complexity forms the backbone of theoretical computer science. The conference aims to foster research in all areas of computational complexity theory, studying the absolute and relative power of computational models under resource constraints. The search for efficient algorithms has important ramifications in many areas of business, technology, and science. Complexity theory has helped with our understanding of fundamental difficulty underlying algorithmic issues and in turn has been able to motivate algorithm design for some of the most challenging computational problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide partial support to approximately 10 students to attend this top conference in the area of complexity theory. Efforts will be made to support students from under-represented groups and geographic diversity among students will be taken into account.&lt;br/&gt;The award will encourage and facilitate the student participation in this top-tier computer science conference. It will contribute towards attracting more under-represented groups to computer science research giving students an opportunity to engage in the important technical, professional, and social ex-changes that CCC fosters.</AbstractNarration>
