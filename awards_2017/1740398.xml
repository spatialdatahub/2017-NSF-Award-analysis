<AbstractNarration>The Computing Systems Research (CSR) program of the NSF funds a wide&lt;br/&gt;range of systems research including (but not limited to) systems for&lt;br/&gt;Internet-of-Things (which makes our homes and city smarter), systems to&lt;br/&gt;make more affordable and energy-efficient our Supercomputers (which&lt;br/&gt;furthers medical research, our understanding of the universe, and&lt;br/&gt;warns the population of tornadoes and hurricanes, to name a few),&lt;br/&gt;systems to improve the usefulness, security, and reliability of our&lt;br/&gt;smartphones, and systems to secure and scale the cloud (which has&lt;br/&gt;expanded the capabilities of IT systems while dramatically decreasing&lt;br/&gt;the associated costs). The project organizes and funds a community&lt;br/&gt;event for all the PIs of awards from the CSR program. At this event,&lt;br/&gt;the researchers funded by the CSR program will have the opportunity to&lt;br/&gt;meet at-large and share and discuss their research and ideas for the&lt;br/&gt;future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project organizes a PI meeting that includes mostly three types of&lt;br/&gt;activities. Plenary presentations will give a forum for the most&lt;br/&gt;remarkable research in the field to be presented and diffused to a&lt;br/&gt;large audience. These presentations are also useful to set the tone&lt;br/&gt;and quality of expected research for the PIs of more recent&lt;br/&gt;awards. Poster presentations of ongoing award enable casual scientific&lt;br/&gt;conversation and person-to-person research diffusion; they are&lt;br/&gt;expected to strengthen the social interaction between CSR researchers&lt;br/&gt;and to lead to new collaborations and synergy in the field. Breakout&lt;br/&gt;sessions will focus on subfield of systems research to summarize&lt;br/&gt;recent successful methodology and identify problems and opportunities&lt;br/&gt;for future work. The project provides a forum for systems researchers to meet and to&lt;br/&gt;form new collaborations, to discuss and to disseminate successful&lt;br/&gt;efforts, to identify the problems and opportunities of the future, and&lt;br/&gt;to maximize the impact of subsequent systems research efforts.</AbstractNarration>
