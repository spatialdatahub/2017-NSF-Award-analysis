<AbstractNarration>With the potential to eliminate the boundary between memory and storage, Non Volatile Memory (NVM) calls for innovations across computing stacks. Existing studies have been mostly focused on the how to ensure data consistency and recoverability when a system crashes with minimum overhead. This proposal aims to enable effective leverage of NVM persistency for computing efficiency. In particular, the research focuses on a central challenge for data reuse: To efficiently enable position independence for dynamic data structures such that all the references in a data object keep their integrity (i.e., point to the correct addresses) regardless of where in the memory space the data object is mapped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NVM is expected to be influential for many computational fields, from database to data analytics, scientific computing, analysis of social networks, modeling of stock transactions and so on. The success of this project may provide key support for effective data reuse on NVM, helping improve computing efficiency and software development productivity on future systems, and hence sustained advancement of science, health, and security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs have a version controlled repository in place at NCSU that has and will be used for data storage and access control. For metadata, documentation will be submitted alongside the data in order to make the data reusable. The data will be archived for at least 10 years.</AbstractNarration>
