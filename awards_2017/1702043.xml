<AbstractNarration>The project will test the hypothesis that the ability of some mammals to change their coat color seasonally, has evolved via a genetic mutation that synchronized the expression of coloration genes and hair growth genes. The results will provide general insights into the processes by which complex traits evolve. Organisms exhibit many complex and interrelated traits that contribute to their success in the environment. However, the evolution of complexity is poorly understood. Investigating the molecular and genetic mechanisms that produce complex traits clarify the origins of biological complexity. This project will explore these mechanisms in the expression of seasonal coat color change in snowshoe hares, which exhibit regional variation in their ability to change color. The project will involve undergraduates in research and project participants will work with the University of Montana School of Media Arts to develop interactive outreach materials based on the study system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Linking genotypes to adaptive phenotypes in nature is a fundamental goal in evolutionary biology. The co-option of existing gene regulatory networks may be an important mechanism underlying the evolution of adaptive traits, particularly adaptive traits that involve coordination among distinct biological processes. This research will explore the role of gene regulatory network co-option in the evolution of seasonal color molts in snowshoe hares. Using RNA sequencing and DNA-protein binding assays in molting snowshoe hare skin, the project will explore the hypothesis that coat color change evolved by the co-option of seasonal hair growth regulatory machinery by coloration genes to synchronize these processes in the seasonal color molts. This research will provide a rare glimpse into the molecular mechanisms involved in the evolution of a complex adaptive trait in a natural population.</AbstractNarration>
