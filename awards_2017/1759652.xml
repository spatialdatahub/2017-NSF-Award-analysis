<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is pleased to announce the selection of Mung Chiang , the Arthur LeGrand Doty Professor of Electrical Engineering at Princeton University, to receive its 2013 Alan T. Waterman Award. Dr. Chiang is also an associated faculty of Computer Science and an affiliated faculty of the Department of Applied and Computational Mathematics at Princeton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Waterman Award is the National Science Foundation's (NSF) highest honor. The annual award recognizes outstanding researchers under the age of 35 in any field of science or engineering that NSF supports. In addition to a medal, this year's awardee will receive a $1 million grant over a five-year period for further advanced study in his field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Chiang, is the founder of the Princeton EDGE Lab, which bridges over the theory-practice divide in networking through collaboration across many disciplinary boundaries as well as the academia-industry boundary. His team constantly re-examines the mathematical crystallization of engineering artifacts in networking.  His research investigates an evolving set of projects spanning the modeling, analysis, and design of networks, both technological and human ones. Prof. Chiang also received the 2012 IEEE Kiyo Tomiyasu Award -for demonstrating the practicality of a new theoretical foundation for the analysis and design of communication networks', a U.S. Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2008, an Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Award in 2007, and a National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 2005. He was named as an MIT Technology Review TR35 Young Innovator in 2007, and was elected an IEEE Fellow in 2012.</AbstractNarration>
