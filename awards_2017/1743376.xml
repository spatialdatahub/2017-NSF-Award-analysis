<AbstractNarration>The ACM MobiCom conference is the leading international conference focusing on systems issues in mobile computing and wireless communications. The topics addressed by MobiCom 2017 are at the core of the current wireless network evolution. The conference attracts research contributions spanning multiple disciplines, including wireless networking, vehicular communications, mobile sensing, personal area networks, mesh networks, distributed algorithms, scheduling, sensors, and signal processing. In addition to the main session, the conference also provides good opportunities to students and researchers to participate in panels, workshops, demos and startup competitions that bring in brilliant ideas and applications in mobile, wireless networking and computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF travel grant program will help increase representation and participation of United States-based graduate and undergraduate students at this conference, and enable sharing of information and preliminary research results among participating students. Participation of top conferences like ACM MobiCom is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing students with an opportunity to interact with more senior researchers, and exposing them to leading edge research in the field. The award will enable graduate students who would be otherwise unable, to attend the main MobiCom 2017 and the associated workshops.</AbstractNarration>
