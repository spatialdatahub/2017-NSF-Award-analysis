<AbstractNarration>This EAPSI award will support efforts that impact the global use of semiconducting polymers, e.g. "semiconducting plastics", that are able to conduct electricity, for military, space and electronic device development. Semiconducting polymers and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/copper (Cu) composites coaxial nanofibers for electronic devices using the Electrospinning technique. CNTs and Cu are well known by their ability to conduct electricity. Their unique properties (electrical behavior and nanofiber structure) can result in fabricated electrical devices that are 1000 times smaller than a human hair. Devices such as diodes, field effect transistors and sensors can be fabricated. Coaxial nanofibers will be prepared using the electrospinning technique, a low-cost, fast and reliable method for nanofiber fabrication. This research will be conducted as a collaboration between the Advanced Materials Bio &amp; Integration Research Laboratory at the University of South Florida (USF) and Dr. Seeram Ramakrishna of the National University of Singapore (NUS). Dr. Ramakrishna is a global research leader in material sciences and a pioneer in the use of electrospinning and nanostructured materials for applications in healthcare, the environment, energy, and defense &amp; security providing a unique insight for electrospinning data acquisition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actual progress in coaxial fibers has advanced in many fields, but, for the first time, two organic semiconductor polymers will form a p-n junction in a coaxial structure, resulting in functional diodes of approximately 100 nm in diameter. These structures, formed with the presence of CNTs, a well-known natural p-type material, and Cu composites, enhances the characteristics of the nanofibers extending the applications of the coaxial structure that can go from single nanofibers to fully functional yarns. This structure can be arranged to form intelligent textiles, electroactive water and air filters, membranes and electronic devices as exposed, advancing the cutting-edge of coaxial nanodevices for efficient cost effective electronic device development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Singapore.</AbstractNarration>
