<AbstractNarration>In this Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site, the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), in partnership with several other departments at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), proposes a REU program focusing on assistive technologies (AT) for people with disabilities (PWD). Undergraduate students are quite capable of performing tangible research, given the right motivation, facilities, mentoring, and guidance. Moreover, participation in active research can greatly enhance their educational experience and can be effective in motivating them to graduate studies. The proposed theme encompasses innovative and novel topics that can help PWD meet barriers of different kinds - attitudinal, architectural, and technological - in accessing employment, navigating public spaces, freely communicating, and living independently. Our REU program is a summer-long research experience for 10 carefully selected participants. The program includes close mentoring that will provide participants with a balance between technology research focus and grounding in pragmatic aspects that shape PWD's lives and assistive applications. The program also encompasses five weeks of intensive training in scientific research techniques and the technical areas, followed by five weeks of instruction in broader aspects of computer coding, technical writing, presentation skills, and aspects of a graduate career. The proposed innovative theme will excite students intellectually, as well as supporting their passion and creativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People who have disabilities make up one of the largest minorities in the world. The World Health Organization estimates as many as 975 million of those 15 years of age and older live with disabilities. For PWD, AT can create a positive influence by removing or reducing many barriers. AT include devices, systems, equipment, and software that make inclusive environments possible and thereby allow PWD to participate fully in society. Through close and frequent interactions between faculty and participants, the proposed theme of AT will expose participants to innovative and novel inter-disciplinary projects through research and prototyping. In the proposed REU program of CSE at UTA, participants will work on computer programming, algorithms, sensors, data analytics, machine learning, and as well as other aspects of basic and applied computer science and engineering. The prototype projects undertaken by REU participants, even though small in nature, will contribute towards inventive methods, techniques, systems, and apps by enhancing the fundamental knowledge base in related fields, while creating new avenues for cross-disciplinary research. By incorporating an important theme of AT in the diversity-rich UTA environment, we expect to increase the pool of diverse and talents students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
