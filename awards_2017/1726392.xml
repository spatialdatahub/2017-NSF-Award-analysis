<AbstractNarration>Mechanical issues are ubiquitous in energy storage, conversion, and harvesting. In rechargeable batteries, which are a key enabler of portable electronics and electrification of automotive transportation, mechanical degradation compromises the performance of current technology and limits the implementation of next-generation high-capacity energy materials. This project seeks to describe the aging mechanisms in batteries, which would also facilitate the development of energy storage materials with enhanced mechanical reliability. This will be achieved through a focus on understanding the fundamental coupling between mechanical forces and electrochemistry or energy storage performance via a close integration of theoretical modeling and experimental characterizations. The outcome of this research will have a broad impact on diverse sectors of the industry, from wearable electronics to electric cars. On the education front, the project will create opportunities to train graduate students in the complex sciences of electrochemistry and mechanics as well as educate students in the mechanics of energy storage materials. The outreach activities will also enhance an existing collaboration with the Women in Engineering program at Purdue to encourage participation of female students in engineering sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this project is to unravel the fundamental coupling between mechanics and electrochemistry using integrated theories and experiments on battery materials.  Research effort include formulating a theory of stress-modulated electron transfer and ion diffusion to understand the effects on energy capacity. Similarly, the continuum theory of stress-composition-reaction coupling will lay a foundation for understanding how mechanical stress modulates the electrochemical processes and how the latter mediates failure and aging of energy materials. The computational modeling of heterogeneous structures in batteries will advance the understanding of stress-regulated kinetics and capacity. The experiments will use energy harvester devices and solid-state batteries in conjunction with a novel electrochemical nano-indenter and coupons based on mechanical testing standards to provide data for the validation of the continuum theories.</AbstractNarration>
