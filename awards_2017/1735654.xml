<AbstractNarration>Groundwater provides 25 percent of fresh water used in the United States, which is especially significant during drought when pumping is increased to compensate for reduced surface supplies. Groundwater depletion is extensive in many areas and there is a critical need to reduce drought vulnerability. This project summarizes the scientific evidence, makes policy recommendations, and illuminates important information gaps, regarding the important relationships between groundwater and drought. This policy research report integrates physical and social science research to provide an understanding of the relationship between groundwater management and drought resilience and communicates results and policy recommendations to local, state and federal agencies and policymakers, academic scholars, water management utilities and water users, as they consider future strategies to reduce drought impacts, including water shortages, through more effective groundwater management. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effective groundwater management requires an interdisciplinary proces.  This project synthesizes and reviews  data from the physical sciences, the social sciences, and the legal and policy literature, to identify knowledge gaps. Issues that will be addressed include the hydrogeophysical characteristics of a basin as these affect groundwater use and management and water supply security, and the potential impact of future droughts under climate change on water supplies and the effect of competing interests and climate uncertainty on decisionmaking regarding groundwater use and management, and the benefits and impacts of particular management approaches and their distribution.  The legal and policy programs that exist to support groundwater security and sustainability and increase drought resilience, and potential incentives that can reduce resource degradation and promote more equitable access are considered. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
