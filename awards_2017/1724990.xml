<AbstractNarration>This proposal supports the NSF Smart and Connected Health (SCH) Principal Investigators Meeting and Visioning Workshop in Boston, MA on March 2-22, 2017. The meeting brings together principal investigators (PI) of projects awarded by the Smart and Connected Health program from 2011 to 2016. The SCH program was set up in order to bridge gaps in fundamental science necessary to transform health and healthcare, as well as to be focused on prevention and person-centered care. In particular, the Visioning Workshop is designed to address the next generation of challenges in advancing health with foundational research from the computer science, engineering and the social, behavioral and economic disciplines.  An objective of the PI Workshop is to provide an opportunity for the principal investigators to explore research progress in a diverse set of funded projects and discuss important current issues, as well as future challenges associated with research in transdisciplinary scientific areas. The discussions will be supported by projects-related posters and further stimulated by cross-talk from the Visioning Workshop. It is anticipated that the meeting will stimulate discussions, connections, and collaborations that will facilitate progress in the area of Smart and Connected Health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop should have a significant impact on the participants and the future of the Smart and Connected Health program (SCH). The focus of the workshop is on foundational research that supports the growth of smart health within connected communities.  The workshop results are likely to include new research directions that will be publicized to the research community through publications and a workshop website. The results dissemination should inform and the developing Smart and Connected Health research community in their transdisciplinary collaboration, educational activities, and spur other innovative research directions. The broader impacts of the workshop are to facilitate progress in the field and stimulate conversations, connections, and collaborations that will lead toward better informed and effective smart and connected health research and resulting technologies for the broadest possible user populations. Additionally, there is a workshop attached to the Principal Investigator meeting that will support the travel for ten students from under-represented STEM disciplines to attend the PI Workshop. This should also help grow the field by providing mentorship and support for a new cadre of investigators looking to do work in the Smart and Connected Health area.</AbstractNarration>
