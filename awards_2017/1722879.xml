<AbstractNarration>To understand the dynamics of Earth's interior and predict ground motions during large earthquakes, seismologists use waves emitted from earthquakes to image structures of the Earth. The traditional receiver function method, which uses medium-size earthquakes thousands of kilometers away as sources, is a popular tool in studying receiver-side discontinuities and depth of sedimentary basins. This research aims to develop a new receiver function method that can take advantage of the rise of dense seismic arrays with hundreds or even thousands of sensors, to produce more detailed and reliable images of the Earth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new receiver-function methodology aims to overcome the limitations introduced by deconvolution at individual stations, by inverting for full receiver function images directly from the waveforms recorded along a dense profile. This approach will produce higher-resolution images because it makes better use of available data and enhances coherent conversions. The researchers will test this new method with available data to image subduction zones in Middle and South America that can generate large or even mega-thrust earthquakes. Additionally, the method will be applied to data collected in a densely populated basin in southern California to better characterize possible ground motions during future large earthquakes.</AbstractNarration>
