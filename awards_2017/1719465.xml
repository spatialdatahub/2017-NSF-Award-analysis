<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Virginia State University (VSU) seeks to enhance the ability of underrepresented minority students to face the challenges of learning science and develop STEM identities to sustain their interest and motivation for pursuit of STEM careers. The proposed intervention, Successfully Transitioning into the Academic Realm (STAR) Program, is designed to facilitate the transition to college-level academics and will build on a previous successful pilot intervention that resulted in an increase in the passing rates for biology majors enrolled in general biology. This project is expected to enhance the ability of underrepresented minority students to face the classroom challenges of learning science, and develop STEM identities which will sustain their interest and motivation to pursue STEM careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The STAR program specific objectives are designed to impact cognitive and non-cognitive factors using evidence-based models. This will be accomplished through curricular enhancements to the general biology course and a peer-mentoring, learning-community based approach. The specific goals are to:  1) integrate critical components of BIOL130 Professional Practices in Biology that have been demonstrated to enhance course outcomes into the general biology course for all STEM majors; 2) develop and implement a peer mentoring structure that integrates evidence-based and piloted practices targeting effective academic habits and maximizing student engagement through learning communities; and 3) implement a rigorous evaluation plan to determine program impacts.</AbstractNarration>
