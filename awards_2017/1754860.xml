<AbstractNarration>This conference award will provide partial support to the 2018 Microtechnologies for Medicine and Biology (MMB) Meeting in Monterey, California, on March 26-28, 2018.  This meeting will provide an outstanding opportunity for networking between young investigators, including trainees, and leaders in the field of microtechnologies.  The themes of the conference include: mechanobiology and biophysics; diagnostic and detection technologies; microphysiological models of living systems; bioassay development; and 3D printing and biomanufacturing. The structure of the conference, including a single room format and 90-second "flash" presentations by poster presenters to introduce their research, will provide a multidisciplinary perspective to all meeting attendees and update everyone on the latest developments within the field.  The conference attendees include stakeholders from the clinical and biomedical industry arenas, which allows for significant exchange of ideas in the furtherance of scientific advancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide financial support for four young investigators and four trainees to attend the international meeting.  Awardees will be selected based on a submitted, 2-page abstract and preference will be given to individuals from groups that are underrepresented in their science and engineering fields.  Over 50 percent of attendees have historically been trainees.  Substantial opportunities are provided for networking, including between young investigators/trainees and leaders in the field.  In addition, partial travel support will be provided to two female keynote speakers.  These individuals will be available for networking with and mentoring of the young investigators and trainees attending the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
