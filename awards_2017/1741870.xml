<AbstractNarration>Partial differential equations are used in a wide variety of applications as&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models. Their numerical solution is, consequently, of prime&lt;br/&gt;importance for the accurate simulation and optimization of processes in the&lt;br/&gt;sciences, engineering, and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;The last decade saw the emergence of large and successful libraries that&lt;br/&gt;support such applications. While these libraries provide most of what such&lt;br/&gt;codes need for small-scale computations, many realistic applications yield&lt;br/&gt;problems of hundreds of millions or billions of unknowns and require clusters&lt;br/&gt;with thousands of processor cores, but there is currently little generic&lt;br/&gt;support for such problems, limiting access to the many large publicly&lt;br/&gt;supported computing facilities to experts in computational science and&lt;br/&gt;excluding scientists from many fields for whom computational simulation would&lt;br/&gt;be a useful tool.  This project intends to build the software infrastructure that will allow a&lt;br/&gt;wide cross section of scientists to utilize these large resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project intends to support the software infrastructure for the&lt;br/&gt;large-scale solution of partial differential equations on massively parallel&lt;br/&gt;computational resources in a generic way. It will build on two of the most&lt;br/&gt;successful libraries for scientific computing, the finite element library&lt;br/&gt;deal.II, and Trilinos that provides the parallel linear algebra capabilities&lt;br/&gt;for the former. Specifically, we will: (i) Make support for massively parallel&lt;br/&gt;computations ubiquitous in deal.II; (ii) Research and develop seamless support&lt;br/&gt;for problems with billions of unknowns in both libraries and improve the&lt;br/&gt;interaction between the two; (iii) Exploit intra-node parallelism on today's&lt;br/&gt;clusters; (iv) Ensure the applicability of our work on a broad basis by&lt;br/&gt;implementing two real-world applications. &lt;br/&gt;Both deal.II and Trilinos have large, active and diverse developer and user&lt;br/&gt;communities, and this project will actively engage these communities through&lt;br/&gt;user meetings, short courses, regularly taught classes, mailing lists, and&lt;br/&gt;direct contact in focused projects.</AbstractNarration>
