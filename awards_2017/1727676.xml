<AbstractNarration>Magnetic shape-memory alloys are metal alloys that can change shape quickly in the presence of a magnetic field. These materials can potentially provide a more robust replacement for complex, high-precision actuation devices, which can be prone to frequent failure. At present, the application of functional magnetic shape-memory alloys is limited by their high cost and difficulty forming into complex shapes. Additive manufacturing, a method of producing parts with very complex shapes in a layer-by-layer fashion, may provide a solution to this problem. This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports fundamental research to understand the effects of additive manufacturing processing on the properties and performance of magnetic shape-memory alloys. This knowledge will enable the production of magnetic shape-memory alloys with complex shapes that can ultimately be used in high precision, large stroke actuators, and will also facilitate manufacturing other magnetic materials with enhanced properties. The collaboration between a university research team and a global US-based company will support fast transition from basic research to application, and will enhance student training. These exciting materials and processes will be used in outreach activities to increase interest and awareness of K-12 students, their teachers and parents in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is hypothesized that magnetic-field-enhanced binder jet additive manufacturing will produce complex-shaped, polycrystalline magnetic shape-memory alloys with aligned microstructures and functional properties that are better than currently casted polycrystalline magnetic shape memory alloys. The basic research in this award will focus on defining how magnetically enhanced binder jet printing affects the microstructure and properties of functional magnetic shape memory alloys over several length scales. In order to test the hypothesis, the research team will (A) investigate the fundamental relationships among impurities, composition, functionality, and sintering and printing parameters, (B) quantify the effects of magnetic alignment parameters on anisotropy and functionality in the as-printed and sintered state, and (C) identify major sources of differences between printed and single crystal magnetic shape memory functional actuator components through performance testing on prototype actuators.</AbstractNarration>
