<AbstractNarration>The Neurobiology of Cognition conference will enhance communication and collaboration among scientists from several disciplines, theoreticians, and technical development specialists.  It emphasizes both the most recent findings in traditional "core" areas, such as memory and decision making, as well as several new themes, including: 1) the evolutionary processes that have led to the human brain's cognitive abilities; 2) implications of machine learning for cognitive neuroscience; and 3) cognition in natural contexts. The program is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together scientists who use behavioral, neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques in humans and non-human animals with investigators who use computational approaches to construct realistic models of cognitive operations to guide future experimentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide registration, or registration and travel, for up to 40 doctoral and postdoctoral trainees and early-career scientists to attend the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), which prepares attendees for more in-depth participation in the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Neurobiology of Cognition that immediately follows. The format promotes intensive interactions among investigators and trainees from different disciplines and, in particular, between experimentalists and theorists.  The program is about 40% female, which approximately matches the base rate representation of women in this sub-discipline of neuroscience.  The GRS and GRC will expose early-career scientists to novel, state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical approaches that promise to elucidate fundamental principles of cognition.</AbstractNarration>
