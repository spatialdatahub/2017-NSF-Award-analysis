<AbstractNarration>The Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) REU in Industrial Mathematics and Statistics provides a distinctive educational experience for students in the mathematical sciences by introducing them to the ways in which mathematicians and statisticians use math in the "real world". Students work in teams on research problems of industrial and mathematical significance that come directly from industry and that are of immediate interest to the companies involved in the program.  Students work closely with company representatives to define the problem and to develop solutions. They work closely with faculty advisors to maintain a clear focus on the mathematics and statistics at the core of the project. This summer research provides challenges not faced in traditional undergraduate programs and helps to develop skills usually not addressed in academic programs. It also provides a glimpse of some of the many career possibilities that are open to students with a strong mathematical background.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU supports 9 undergraduate students for 9 weeks during the summer on 2 to 3 different industrial projects.  Students develop a project goals statement in the first week, in collaboration with a faculty advisor and a company liaison.  Over the next seven weeks, students conduct the actual research while presenting their progress to both an academic audience at WPI and a corporate audience at the sponsoring company.  In the final week, students give their final oral presentations at WPI and the company and submit a written report. Professional development activities presenting mathematical career options in academia and industry complement the program.  The selection process focuses on students with a strong academic background but with limited opportunities for research in mathematics at their home institutions.  One selection emphasis is an openness to pursue a range of research directions which an industrial problem may require. Successful research teams have been multifaceted and diverse, and therefore members of underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences are especially encouraged to apply.</AbstractNarration>
