<AbstractNarration>After 50 years the climate history on Venus is still a mystery to planetary scientists. Using various computer models we can observe if Venus has undergone a climate change in recent history. Studying climate change is fundamental in explaining Venus as it is today. Understanding the climate will constrain the atmospheric composition in the near surface environment, illuminate the possible weather patterns that can exist on Venus, and possibly determine the origin of the low emissivity metal frost on the mountain tops. Venus and Earth were once identical planets of similar origin, atmosphere, and geology. By understanding the Venusian atmosphere it may help us figure out how and why Earth and Venus diverged from one another and assist us in better understanding planetary formation. Venus' atmosphere is comprised of 97% CO2 and so is a perfect example of the effects of runaway greenhouse effect, a problem currently plaguing our planet. If we can determine why Venus is so hot and how high concentrations of CO2 can affect the surface conditions, we can learn more about climate change on Earth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using global circulation, radiative heat transfer, and chemical composition at equilibrium models we can observe if Venus has undergone a recent climate change that could account for the metal frost in the mountain tops. Using the codes we will alter the temperature of the atmosphere, for example by injecting hot or cold air into the circulation model to see how it will disburse around Venus and affect the temperature of the surface. This change in temperature may modify the formation and composition of clouds and precipitates. From there we can study possible interactions between the atmosphere and the surface. In order to study this the PI will work under the mentorship of Dr. George Hashimoto of Okayama University to develop a code together to model surface-atmosphere chemical reactions. Using the Japanese Space Agency's orbiter, Akatsuki, we can use the IR1 camera to study the surface at various levels and compare the surface emissivities with our results to see if the minerals are the same. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>
