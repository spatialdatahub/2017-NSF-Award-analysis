    <AbstractNarration>The National Geospatial Technology Center of Excellence (GeoTech Center) is a collaborative effort of two-year colleges, universities, and industry to accomplish the vision of increasing the number and diversity of learners and workers who possess industry-defined geospatial technology (GST) skills and competencies. The need for a GST workforce that possesses current industry-defined skills and competencies is expanding at a rapid rate. Today, GST is becoming an essential tool in fields including (but not limited to) emergency response, sustainability, agro-science, energy, and a variety of STEM disciplines. These occupations require a skillset in the analysis of spatial data and geo-visualization. One impact of this project will be the national expansion and diversification of a GST workforce that possesses relevant and current industry-defined GST skills and competencies. GeoTech Center research has identified a lack of educational materials to meet the needs of the broad geospatial community of users. Curricula that are standardized and contextual, and that can be used in traditional college learning environments, as well as by individuals for self-improvement, is desperately needed. The GeoTech Center will design and develop industry-aligned educational materials that can be used in a modularized format and portable to different learning environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GeoTech Center has four integrated Goals: 1) Research emerging trends and uses of GST; 2) Develop industry-aligned curriculum for new and incumbent users of GST; 3) Investigate best practices to increase (and retain) the number of underserved and underrepresented populations (including veterans, women, minority groups, and persons with disabilities) into GST and STEM fields; and 4) Develop and implement professional development opportunities and resources for secondary and post-secondary faculty. In order to successfully accomplish its Goals, the Center will build on strong, documented relationships with professional GST organizations and provide new and current workers access to educational resources to assist them in filling any gaps in their GST skillset (and for them to receive recognition of those skills through micro-credentials and professional certifications). The Center will expand its Community of Practice and address specific educational needs of targeted audiences, including underserved and underrepresented students, veterans, and faculty in STEM disciplines. The efforts of the Center to accomplish its Goals will provide the optimum framework and resources to increase the number and diversity of learners and workers who possess industry-defined GST skills and competencies.</AbstractNarration>
