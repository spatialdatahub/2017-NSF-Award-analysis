<AbstractNarration>Part 1: The Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (CERF) will convene a workshop and related activities focused on broadening participation in our scientific society, and in coastal and estuarine sciences.  Despite widespread recognition of the value of increasing participation of underrepresented minorities (URM) in the sciences, URMs are still significantly underrepresented in marine science. CERF is a multidisciplinary organization committed to advancing scientific understanding of estuaries and coasts and to promoting an inclusive culture for URMs in coastal and estuarine science.  The project will provide a targeted mechanism for URM students to participate in CERF?s conference and a URM-focused workshop, and engage a large cross-section of CERF members in discussions on expanding inclusiveness.  Results of the workshop and related activities will form the basis of CERF's comprehensive Broadening Participation Implementation Plan for achieving the diversity goals and objectives in the society's 2017-2022 Strategic Plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2:  This project will support diversity and inclusion efforts at CERF?s 2017 Biennial Conference, November 5-8, 2017, in Providence, RI.  CERF will provide support for URM students and mentors to participate in the conference, including URM student professional development through cohort building, mentoring, and participation in a URM-focused workshop, scientific sessions, and other conference activities.  The project will also build the capacity of CERF to achieve diversity and inclusion objectives through a transformative workshop focused on diversity issues and integrating conversations on inclusiveness throughout the CERF conference through varied activities.</AbstractNarration>
