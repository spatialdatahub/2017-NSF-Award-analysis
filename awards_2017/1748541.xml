<AbstractNarration>Robots are increasingly being integrated into society, from service robots to autonomous cars.  To be both safe and efficient, however, they need to better understand how people navigate in unstructured environments and plan paths that take people's own paths into consideration.  The planning methods developed in this project will generate robot paths that satisfy the dual goals of minimizing the robot's risks of collision with people while simultaneously minimizing its expected task completion time. Unique to this work, the robot dynamically estimates how predictable pedestrians are behaving at any point in time and adapts its plans accordingly, automatically taking safer, more conservative, paths when in less predictable situations, and emphasizing efficiency when the situation is more predictable.  The ability for robots to autonomously plan and execute safe, efficient paths in human environments will improve their ability to operate in collaboration with humans, especially in crowded situations, such as in factories, schools, hospitals, or malls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The navigation method developed follows a sense-plan-predict-act loop where robot plans are computed by finding medium-to-long term trajectories that avoid collision with an expected future distribution of likely obstacle states. The goals of this work split into two tasks: The first improves existing pedestrian path-modeling techniques by augmenting the predictions with estimates of uncertainty.  This is accomplished through an iterative maximum-likelihood framework. The second task finds robot trajectories that minimize a path-cost function, accounting for both control and collision costs, while respecting robot dynamics. This is done using an iterative, gradient-based trajectory optimization approach.  The resulting navigation approach is evaluated in both simulation and on real pedestrian data.</AbstractNarration>
