<AbstractNarration>The Texas Algebraic Geometry Symposium (TAGS) will take place on April 21-23 2017 at Rice University in Houston, Texas. TAGS is an annual conference that is hosted on a rotating basis by Rice University, Texas A&amp;M University, and the University of Texas at Austin. Many phenomena in nature can be modeled using systems of polynomial equations. The study of such systems is an important area of mathematics known as algebraic geometry. This grant supports participation in a conference in this subject, providing investigators from Texas and neighboring states an opportunity to learn the newest developments in this field from distinguished invited speakers. This conference is also an important opportunity for local researchers, especially graduate students and postdocs, to meet and interact, gaining exposure for their work and potentially establishing new collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Texas Algebraic Geometry Symposium provides an opportunity for local researchers to meet and interact, as well as learn the latest advances in algebraic geometry, interpreted in its broadest sense. This year, specific areas of focus include Hodge theory, moduli theory of curves, derived categories, Chow groups, and algebraic K-theory. Young mathematicians (graduate students and postdoctoral researchers) will have the opportunity to present their work in a poster session.
