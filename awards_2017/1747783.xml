<AbstractNarration>This project establishes the NSF Industry/University Collaborative Research Center for Big Learning (CBL). The vision is to create intelligence towards intelligence-driven society. Through catalyzing the fusion of diverse expertise from the consortium of faculty members, students, industry partners, and federal agencies, CBL seeks to create state-of-the-art deep learning methodologies and technologies and enable intelligent applications, transforming broad domains, such as business, healthcare, Internet-of-Things, and cybersecurity. This timely initiative creates a unique platform for empowering our next-generation talents with cutting-edge technologies of societal relevance and significance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project establishes the NSF Industry/University Collaborative Research Center for Big Learning (CBL) at University of Florida (UF). With substantial breakthroughs in multiple modalities of challenges, such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language understanding, the renaissance of machine intelligence is dawning. The CBL vision is to create intelligence towards intelligence-driven society. The mission is to pioneer novel deep learning algorithms, systems, and applications through unified and coordinated efforts in the CBL consortium. The UF Site will focus on intelligent platforms and applications and closely collaborate with other sites on deep learning algorithms, systems, and applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CBL will have broad transformative impacts in technologies, education, and society. CBL aims to create pioneering research and applications to address a broad spectrum of real-world challenges, making significant contributions and impacts to the deep learning community. The discoveries from CBL will make significant contributions to promote products and services of industry in general and CBL industry partners in particular. As the magnet of deep learning research and applications, CBL offers an ideal platform to nurture next-generation talents through world-class mentors from both academia and industry, disseminates the cutting-edge technologies, and facilitates industry/university collaboration and technology transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The center repository will be hosted at http://nsfcbl.org. The data, code, documents will be well organized and maintained on the CBL servers for the duration of the center for more than five years and beyond. The internal code repository will be managed by GitLab. After the software packages are well documented and tested, they will be released and managed by popular public code hosting services, such as GitHub and Bitbucket.</AbstractNarration>
