<AbstractNarration>Palo Alto College (PAC) will provide scholarships for 39 academically talented biology and bioscience students and address the challenge community colleges face in providing experiential research opportunities to students. The project combines scholarship support, faculty mentoring, and peer tutoring with Projects of Discovery (PODs), a course-based approach to involving community college students in interdisciplinary research. This method of instruction, involving both STEM and non-STEM classes, is expected to improve students' self-efficacy, making it more likely that students will persist in their major. PAC is a federally designated Hispanic Serving Institution, and this work will provide significant insights into recruiting and retaining HSI students into STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to increase the number of academically talented biology and bioscience majors who transfer from a community college and graduate with a bachelor's degree in a STEM field within six years.  Integrating research on the best practices in persistence and retention strategies for Hispanic STEM majors, the project will address key academic, cognitive, and socio-cultural factors that influence Hispanic students' success in STEM degree attainment and will advance understanding of these issues while promoting teaching, training, and learning through faculty mentorship, peer interactions, and cohort building activities. The PODs developed will require only minor changes to established course modules and will assist other community colleges in implementing similar PODs-based research opportunities to support STEM majors in gaining the self-confidence, science identity, and cognitive skills that undergraduate research experiences provide. The knowledge generation activities will examine how course-based undergraduate research opportunities engage students at a Hispanic-Serving Institution, and improve persistence and completion outcomes at a Hispanic-Serving community college.</AbstractNarration>
