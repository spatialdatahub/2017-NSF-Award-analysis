<AbstractNarration>This project, from Carnegie Mellon University, creates an I-Corps Site at this institution. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Type II proposal, requesting a "renewal" of funding for an existing I-Corps Site. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A primary goal of the CMU I-Corps Site is to build a comprehensive program that is adaptable to other universities and regions across the country; one that leverages and augments local resources and that integrates into the NSF I-Corps program. To this end, the CMU I-Corps Site works with a network of regional Sites and national Nodes to prepare teams to enter the National I-Corps training program. The CMU I-Corps Site model curriculum incorporates an agile methodology focused on customer discovery and product adaptation, and provides effective mentoring, strong collaborations with regional stakeholders, and the incorporation of programs and perspectives of regional partners. A goal is to create an entrepreneurial community of students, faculty and community members who not only benefit directly from the program, but also become experts in mentoring and advising others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CMU I-Corps Site accelerates the effective transfer of university research into successful commercial ventures, enabling government funded university research and innovations to promote regional growth and benefit the public. Many sectors serve to gain, for example, healthcare, transportation, energy, and sustainability. Incorporating regional expertise and collaboration benefits both the university and the community and helps broaden participation. The program provides an adaptable model to strengthen the entrepreneurial and innovation ecosystem of universities, their regions and the nation.</AbstractNarration>
