<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) supports conferences that seek to increase the research capacity of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty at HBCUs. Howard University will conduct its second Women in STEM Conference for women scientists, researchers, graduate students and faculty from Historically Disadvantaged Institutions (HDIs) in South Africa and from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the United States. The conference will be held October 23 to 28, 2017, on the campus of Howard University. This conference award supports women STEM faculty from Historically Black Colleges and Universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the conference is to bring together leaders from academia, industry and government to collaborate on strategies to attract and retain women in STEM. Particular attention will be targeted on women of color faculty in STEM from HBCUs in the US and from HDIs in South Africa. The conference will focus on exploring the following questions: What are the similarities in professional trajectory among women in STEM in South Africa and in the US?  What is the professional climate for women in STEM in South Africa and the US? Are programs used in the US to improve culture and climate issues applicable to South Africa and vice versa? Are there unique opportunities or challenges for women in STEM at HBCUs and HDIs? How can HBCU and HDI STEM women faculty partner to encourage more South African women to purse STEM terminal degrees and faculty careers? The plenary sessions and breakout sessions on each full day of the conference will be devoted to addressing one of the guiding questions. The final conference session will summarize the recommendations and solutions proposed by the conference participants.</AbstractNarration>
