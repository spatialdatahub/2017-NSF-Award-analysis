<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The National Science Foundation 'Back to the Future' Research Experience for Undergraduates Site at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology will expose a diverse group of undergraduate students, including Native American students and women, to the research environment and to help them develop as professionals. The focus of the student research is the study of metals and metal production, an area of vital technological importance to national interest in areas of defense, manufacturing, resource utilization, and energy. Students will also participate in research projects with the National Park Service focused on the preservation and analysis of historical artifacts as well as activities that highlight the importance of metals throughout history, hence, the 'Back to the Future' theme. This context will give students a broader appreciation for the nature of current and future research as well as the impact of engineering in society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The REU Site: Back to the Future at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology is a 10-week summer project that will provide research opportunities in metallurgical and materials engineering that enhance the global competitiveness of the nation in the areas of advanced materials and manufacturing, mineral beneficiation and resource recovery, strategic metals, and energy-efficient materials. The project will address challenges faced by future engineers by providing a research experience within a unique cultural and holistic framework. This framework will be provided by teaming with the National Parks Service on research that has historical significance and innovative activities led by faculty from engineering, science and the humanities that explore the interface between engineering, history, and art (the Back to the Future theme). Students will participate in an integrated supplemental training program that nurtures their research skills and career development. This program includes advanced technical communications training, workshops and seminars to give historical context for current trends in research, as well as activities that connect students to each other and the community. The diverse nature of program activities will attract students of varied background and intellectual typology. The Site will provide opportunities for underserved students in engineering with an emphasis on two-year community and Tribal Colleges from the region. The site will also strengthen ongoing Native American NSF initiatives in the region including All Nations Louis Stokes, Tiospaye, and the Oglala Lakota College / South Dakota State University / South Dakota School of Mines Pre-Engineering Education Collaborative (OSSPEC). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
