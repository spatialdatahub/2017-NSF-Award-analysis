<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it will potentially reduce fatal errors associated with compounded sterile preparations (CSP).  This will save lives and save money by preventing dose errors and wastage of costly medications and accessories when CSP's are incorrectly made. This I-Corps project will also explore similar problems that can also have life threatening consequences. The project will help to discern how various types of errors encountered in industrial processes can be minimized by integrating technology and human intervention at various workplaces. The product will help to gain understanding about how machines and people interact so as to design better workflow practices related to the CSP preparation and other relevant health care/industrial processes. The design of the technology allows usage in virtual simulation centers and other educational settings to train technical personnel, students, and professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project involves a computational decision support system (CDSS) product that was developed to address severe shortcomings in compounded sterile preparations (CSP).  Current procedures can result in fatal errors, inappropriate techniques, and noncompliance issues.  The first feature of the CDSS is an audio-visual interface for the compounding technician to identify and pick the correct materials and accessories to prepare a CSP. The second feature of the CDSS tracks, monitors, and evaluates the methods used by a technician compounding the injectable medication through image and video processing. The third feature of the CDSS checks and confirms the volume of a liquid injection contained in a syringe. The CDSS product can digitally document all the steps during this process enabling real time feedback during compounding so that errors can be corrected immediately. The technology also records the techniques used during compounding to ensure that proper procedures were followed according to regulatory guidelines. The CDSS thus provides timely warnings and real time feedback during preparation of a CSP and documents all aspects of the process that can be fully integrated with quality assurance (QA) programs.</AbstractNarration>
