<AbstractNarration>Nationally, there is increasing interest in broadening the participation of minority males in engineering and other STEM-related fields. Compared to White and Asian males, many minority males are underrepresented in engineering. Throughout the theoretical and scientific literature, there is a dearth of research focused on minority males in engineering, especially on Black male students who have participated in engineering or other STEM-related mentoring programs and experiences. There are also very little scientific and popular literature that examines, specifically, how such programs may impact Black male middle school-aged students' academic and career interest in engineering. This research project is both timely and important to the National Science Foundation as well as other U. S. governmental agencies that are working to diversify the engineering workforce throughout the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comprising quantitative and qualitative research methods,investigators from Bowie State University and Morgan State University outlined a comprehensive exploratory, mixed-method study that aims to pinpoint the different factors that shape Black middle school-aged students' interest in engineering and determine what specific experiences actually influence their understanding of engineering and other STEM-related fields. It is quite likely that the research findings will offer important insights on middle school-aged, Black males and how engineering and other STEM-related programs and experiences can influence their academic interests and career aspirations. Further, secondary and postsecondary professionals will be able to use the project findings to improve formal and informal engineering and other STEM-related learning experiences for Black middle school-aged students.</AbstractNarration>
