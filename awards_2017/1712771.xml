<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in their efforts to significantly increase the numbers of students matriculating into and successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines in order to diversify the STEM workforce.  Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  The Urban Massachusetts Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (UMLSAMP) program was established in 2007 in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce.  That need still exists and is particularly acute in the Eastern Region of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  Participating institutions include three University of Massachusetts campuses (Boston, Dartmouth and Lowell); Wentworth Institute of Technology; and four community college partners (Bristol, Bunker Hill, Middlesex, and Roxbury).  The UMLSAMP's goals are to increase the number of 1) Black, Hispanic, and Native American STEM students by 50%; 2) Baccalaureate STEM degrees awarded to Black, Hispanic, and Native American students by 150%; and 3) Students who successfully transfer from Alliance community colleges into BS STEM majors by 150%.  These goals support the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to "cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens."  The goals will be accomplished by strategies based on the previous 10 years of Alliance experience to include but are not limited to:  Facilitated Study Groups, Supplemental Instruction, Research Skills Development Workshops, Mentored Research Experiences for Undergraduates in STEM, and Community Service Projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge generating research study will employ a multi-layered, mixed-methods design with the supposition that understanding the specific programmatic aspects that contribute to LSAMP's success, institutionalizing these at Alliance institutions, and replicating them across the higher education sector can make a significant contribution to diversifying the nation's STEM-skilled workforce in all fields.  Lessons learned and programmatic outcomes will be disseminated through online communication channels, participation in national and international student success and STEM related conferences and workshops, and peer-reviewed publications.  Progress towards project goals will be carefully tracked internally in accordance with the UMLSAMP Logical Model and through the engagement of an external evaluator.</AbstractNarration>
