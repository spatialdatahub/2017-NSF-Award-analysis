<AbstractNarration>1738307&lt;br/&gt;Lauchnor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to partially support an international conference, Wetland Systems for Water Pollution Control (WETPOL) to be held August 21-25, 2017, Big Sky, Montana. This conference is the leading international conference on applications of natural and engineered wetlands for water quality improvement and has been convened biennially since 2005. The goals of the conference include making connections between fundamental science and engineered wetland applications, knowledge transfer between the different areas of wetland research and technology, increasing knowledge and acceptance of wetlands for water treatment and making cultural connections between diverse regions with different needs and potential uses for wetland technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treatment wetlands have undergone recent design advances that have drastically improved their treatment performance. In addition, treatment wetlands provide a low cost, low energy wastewater treatment alternative that can provide ecosystem services and aesthetic appeal. Despite these recent technological advancements, current understanding of the fundamental processes responsible for effective contaminant removal remains limited. By bringing together experts in treatment wetlands technology and those scientists, engineers and practitioners focused on natural wetlands and restoration of wetland systems for ecological purposes advances in understanding fundamental processes will result. The participants which are experts in natural wetlands and wetland restoration gain access too many case studies and other controlled experiments conducted by treatment wetland experts, allowing them to better understand fundamental processes affecting wetland ecology and biogeochemistry. Support for students will greatly increase the potential for their participation at the conference on treatment wetland design and participate in developing a more thorough understanding of wetlands. Industry participation in WETPOL will promote the use and development of wetland technology for various water treatment applications in the U.S. Hosting this conference in the U.S. for the first time will help to increase awareness of the benefits of treatment wetlands and enhance the potential for consultants to implement treatment wetlands and wetland restoration projects. Many U.S. communities that are conducive to small-scale, onsite wastewater treatment systems can benefit from the interactions and knowledge gained from this conference. In addition, knowledge of treatment wetlands applications for treating industrial, mining and agricultural wastewater can benefit those sectors in regions of the U.S.</AbstractNarration>
