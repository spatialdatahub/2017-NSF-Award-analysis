<AbstractNarration>The award will provide funding in support of participation by U.S. graduate students and post-doctoral researchers at the 2017 Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) and Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Chemical Reactions at Surfaces to be held back-to-back in Lucca (Barga), Italy, February 4-10, 2017. The conference and seminar will expose a new generation of scientists and engineers to the latest international advances in the area of surface science and engineering as applied to some of the world's most pressing technological challenges.  International exchanges of this type are essential for ensuring that U.S. scientists and engineers maintain leadership in areas of critical importance to the environment, sustainability, and manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GRC on Chemical Reactions at surfaces is the preeminent international meeting in the field of surface chemistry and related catalysis. Together with the GRS, it will bring together an interdisciplinary group of students and young researchers from chemistry, physics, chemical engineering and materials science. They will have an opportunity to present their work in the form of oral presentations or posters while interacting with some of the most eminent researchers in the field. The GRS and GRC will address fundamental aspects of surface chemical reactions, which are related to the grand environmental and sustainability challenges facing mankind. These include environmental interfaces, solar energy conversion to chemical energy, and capture and storage of CO2. Specific emphasis will be given to defining the next generation challenges in surface chemistry and surface science. Participation by young researchers will add significant value to this conference and will foster communications among current and future leaders in a field that combines academic and industrial issues.</AbstractNarration>
