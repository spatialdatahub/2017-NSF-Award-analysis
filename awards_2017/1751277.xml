<AbstractNarration>The amount of digital information being generated doubles every two&lt;br/&gt;years. As a result, storage systems have to handle an ever increasing&lt;br/&gt;amount of data each day. Data is often stored on solid state&lt;br/&gt;drives(SSDs)for good performance. Unfortunately, SSDs have a limited&lt;br/&gt;lifetime and will fail after a certain number of writes. Anticipated future&lt;br/&gt;storage technologies such as Intel 3D XPoint also have limited&lt;br/&gt;lifetime. Unfortunately, current storage systems have high&lt;br/&gt;input/output (IO) amplification: 100 gigabytes written to the&lt;br/&gt;widely-used RocksDB key-value store will result in 2.7 terabytes (28x)&lt;br/&gt;written to storage. Solving the problem of storage failure due to IO&lt;br/&gt;amplification is crucial to building storage systems of the future&lt;br/&gt;that can handle the exponentially increasing amount of data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to build IO-Efficient systems&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure that drastically reduces the amount of writes to&lt;br/&gt;storage without compromising on performance. To achieve this goal,&lt;br/&gt;this project contributes new data structures, techniques, and designs&lt;br/&gt;of storage systems. Taking an end-to-end approach, this project&lt;br/&gt;redesigns each layer of the storage stack, including key-value stores,&lt;br/&gt;transactional stores, and file systems, while tuning the underlying&lt;br/&gt;storage device to reduce IO amplification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will significantly impact academia by advancing the&lt;br/&gt;state-of-the-art, industry through technology transfer, students via&lt;br/&gt;courses and projects, and the general public by providing better&lt;br/&gt;open-source storage systems. Undergraduate and graduate students will&lt;br/&gt;be trained in the careful analysis and building of advanced storage&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure. This project will encourage the participation of women&lt;br/&gt;and other under-represented minorities in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All software artifacts related to this project will be maintained at&lt;br/&gt;the project website&lt;br/&gt;(http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/io-efficient-infra.htm) for the&lt;br/&gt;lifetime of this project. All storage systems developed as part of&lt;br/&gt;this project will be open-sourced, with sufficient documentation to&lt;br/&gt;enable ease-of-use. Other tools and benchmarks developed&lt;br/&gt;during the course of this project will also be made publicly available&lt;br/&gt;in text form for easy processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
