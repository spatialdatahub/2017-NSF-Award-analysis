<AbstractNarration>The proposed project will bring together researchers in a workshop to be held in November 13-15, 2017 at the Days Inn Penn State in State College, PA. The Workshop will address research areas of a wide range of non-graphene 2D atomic layers such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), transition metal di-chalcogenides, tertiary compounds of carbo-nitrides and complex oxides, as well as their applications in various devices. The Workshop will bring the NSF EFRI Two- Dimensional Atomic-Layer Research and Engineering (2-DARE) supported researchers together with those supported by the Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) and Materials Innovation Platform (MIP) programs. By bringing together researchers to discuss cutting-edge research in the above areas the Workshop will catalyze important collaborations. It will also impact training of a globally engaged workforce which will help promoting science and engineering breakthroughs. Graduate students, postdoctoral scholars and junior faculty will comprise a significant portion of the attendees and will benefit from exposure to cutting-edge research in 2D materials and devices and the application of theory/simulation/data analytics to materials discovery.</AbstractNarration>
