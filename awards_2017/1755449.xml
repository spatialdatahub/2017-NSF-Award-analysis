<AbstractNarration>Part 1&lt;br/&gt;The Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) Program, an international educational and citizen science program, provides students and the public worldwide with the opportunity to participate in data collection, analysis, and the scientific process, while contributing meaningfully to our understanding of the Earth system and global environment. The 6th GLOBE Learning Expedition (GLE) and the 22nd GLOBE Annual Meeting will be held in Killarney Ireland July 1-6, 2018. The theme of the GLE meeting is Connecting Mountain, Woods and Lake Biomes: Developing a Special Sense of Place for the GLOBE Community. The GLEs are organized every four or five years in order to provide students from around the world the opportunity to present their research projects to their peers, to GLOBE scientists, and to the wider GLOBE community. GLEs also provide students with the opportunity to participate in a collective place-based research experience, learn about each other's cultures, and to develop collaborative partnerships that will enhance their future GLOBE, academic and career experiences. The GLOBE Community consists of students, teachers and scientists in over 100 U.S. Partnerships and 100 Partner Countries. The GLOBE Implementation Office will arrange all the logistics. Over 250 adult participants and 150 students are expected to attend the week-long event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2&lt;br/&gt;Concerns over the number of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics(STEM) graduates has been mounting for decades, and has risen to a new level with the publication of recent reports. These reports all point to the lack of qualified STEM graduates to meet short and long-term workforce needs of the nation's economy. The previous two federal administrations have touted the need for more emphasis on STEM education. In addition, GLOBE is an excellent vehicle for making connections between formal and informal environments (through public participation in science) and for creating and sustaining STEM interest in students in all levels of the educational system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific objectives for this meeting include:&lt;br/&gt;1) Students share their learning/experiences related to GLOBE-based research to peers;&lt;br/&gt;2) Students participate in science and motivate each other through real-time interactions;&lt;br/&gt;3) Participants (scientists, teachers, Country Coordinators, US Partners) share experiences, collaborate in&lt;br/&gt;doing science and celebrate accomplishments;&lt;br/&gt;4) Participants learn more about GLOBE and how students from different backgrounds can contribute to&lt;br/&gt;science and understanding about our planet;&lt;br/&gt;5) Teachers and students share how GLOBE activities are being conducted in their schools; and&lt;br/&gt;6) Students collaborate with each other through using protocols to study the local environment during the&lt;br/&gt;GLOBE Games.</AbstractNarration>
