<AbstractNarration>Microplastics are small plastic particles (less than 5 millimeters in diameter) in the environment, and they can come from a variety of sources.  This research project is designed to utilize citizen scientists from a local middle school to collect data on microplastic pollution and integrate its detection into water quality monitoring. Project researchers will train and work with undergraduate science education research students, local teachers, and students (citizen scientists) in water quality research to study microplastic pollution in the Lake Michigan watershed. Citizen scientists will be trained to 1) conduct traditional water quality monitoring procedures, 2) quantify and study the transport and fate of microplastic pollutants and 3) determine the extent of microplastic materials consumed by common macroinvertebrates in the watershed. This large data set collection, which can be compiled effectively using citizen scientists, is also necessary for microplastic pollution mitigation strategies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microplastic pollution is created from a number of sources and is defined as plastic waste materials less than 5 millimeters in diameter. This pollution is considered a threat on a global level due to the abundance, persistence and mobility of these plastic materials. While many studies have been performed on microplastic pollution have in the marine environment, recent scientific reports conclude that more research is necessary, especially in freshwater ecosystems. The project researchers are expanding upon traditional water quality monitoring by quantifying and analyzing the microplastic pollution in the local Lake Michigan watershed through the development of a citizen science program. The research includes investigations on the degree of uptake of microplastics by common macroinvertebrates in local headwater streams and the probable effects on these organisms. The full extent of microplastic pollution on organisms and humans is not yet known and additional research is required to address many unknown aspects of these pollutants. The project includes training of citizen scientists from a local public middle school. The project also provides an opportunity for the community to take part in critical research on current stresses to freshwater systems. Undergraduate science major students are taking part in the multi-disciplinary research and are being challenged with teaching research methods to the middle school citizen scientists as part of their teacher education preparation.</AbstractNarration>
