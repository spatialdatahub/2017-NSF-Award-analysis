<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2017 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Physical Metallurgy has a subtitle: Frontiers of&lt;br/&gt;Quantification and Predictive Capability in Physical Metallurgy. The GRC is one of the most highly&lt;br/&gt;acclaimed topical conferences in the field of physical metallurgy.  Held every two years, it provides a&lt;br/&gt;unique forum for in-depth discussion of cut-edging advances in the field and pathways to the future.  The&lt;br/&gt;associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) provides a forum for early career researchers and students to&lt;br/&gt;showcase their work and to participate at career discussions.  The GRS will be held on July 22-23, and the GRC&lt;br/&gt;will be on July 23-28, 2017, both at University of New England, Biddeford, Maine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of Physical Metallurgy is currently seeing major changes in its research aims from qualitative&lt;br/&gt;understanding to quantitative predictive capability. This is largely driven by our ability to handle massive&lt;br/&gt;3D data describing the structure of materials, to locally evaluate materials properties, and to acquire&lt;br/&gt;systematic data series in high-throughput experiments. As 3D imaging is transitioning from technique&lt;br/&gt;development to application, it permits one to test modeling approaches at different levels of complexity&lt;br/&gt;and spatial resolution. Here, the direct modeling and simulation of experiments and the inverse modeling&lt;br/&gt;of the experimental results just begin to demonstrate their analytic power and their power to increase the&lt;br/&gt;accuracy of the measurements. Meanwhile, the classical core of the field, modeling of materials behavior&lt;br/&gt;and of structure-property relations, is still challenged by the difficulties to seamlessly transition between&lt;br/&gt;different modeling scopes from atoms to materials defects to continuum field equations. The frontiers of&lt;br/&gt;the field therefore are concerned with the systematization and the quantification of information on&lt;br/&gt;materials and with the assessment and increase of the predictive capability of the modeling and&lt;br/&gt;simulation. Modeling and simulation is beginning to provide thermodynamic information on materials in&lt;br/&gt;complex environments. Small scale experiments can be pushed to the scale of individual defects and can&lt;br/&gt;challenge modeling particularly concerning the mechanical properties of materials: fracture, fatigue,&lt;br/&gt;friction and wear. Additive manufacturing is posing new challenges to modeling and at the same time&lt;br/&gt;opens entirely new avenues to alloy development. The aim of this Gordon Conference is to assess these&lt;br/&gt;current frontiers of the field and to sketch central questions which the community will have to solve for&lt;br/&gt;Physical Metallurgy to advance as a field that spans from understanding atomistic processes on&lt;br/&gt;femtosecond time scales to assessing the behavior of structural components for years in service.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
