<AbstractNarration>Increasing enrollments in STEM should reflect the nation's diversity. This creates a compelling need to ensure access and support to economically-disadvantaged and first generation students pursuing STEM careers. It is imperative to understand which interventions most effectively support these students. This project will award 100 scholarships over five years to first year and transfer students entering West Texas A&amp;M University (WTAMU) as engineering or mathematics students. It is designed to promote and ensure the retention and graduation of engineering and mathematics students from three underrepresented and/or disadvantaged populations: (1) rural, economically-disadvantaged students; (2) minority students; and (3) first-generation college students at this Hispanic Serving Institution. This project will compare the benefit of financial support alone to the benefit of receiving support that includes financial assistance as well as academic, social, and career support. The project will also identify the modifications to traditional learning communities and Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) models required to address the challenges facing underrepresented students in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop well-trained professionals who are ready to contribute to the economic growth and competitiveness of the nation's work force. The project has three objectives: (1) increase the recruitment, retention, student success, and graduation of low-income, academically talented students pursuing degrees in STEM fields; (2) adapt, implement, and study models of effective evidence-based practices, and strategies that contribute to understanding of how these practices affect recruitment, retention, and student success; and (3) contribute to the implementation of co-curricular PLTL and Experiential Learning activities. The project will recruit academically talented students from regional high schools and partnering community colleges with large minority and economically disadvantaged populations. Scholarships will reduce or eliminate the need for students to seek employment while pursuing their degrees.  The program will establish learning communities and block scheduling for students with similar educational trajectories. The communities will be involved in peer-led team learning, experiential learning, workforce exposure, and career counseling to foster social and academic success. This will further enhance the likelihood of persistence in STEM and STEM careers. The interaction of student cohorts will encourage the exchange of ideas. It will also foster appreciation of the interdependence and interdisciplinary nature of the sciences. Results from the project will provide a model for higher education providers in states across the nation experiencing growth in the Hispanic population and other underrepresented groups to recruit, retain, and increase degree attainment of undergraduate students in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
