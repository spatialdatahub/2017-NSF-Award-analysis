<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Programs. Professor Ernest Nolen from Colgate University and colleagues Richard Geier (III) and Anthony Chianese have acquired a console upgrade for a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the structural study of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is important to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, forensics and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students via independent student research and traditional academic coursework. Students work on these projects during independent studies, summer research, and senior projects - activities which prepare them to enter competitive graduate programs and/or industries across the country. In addition, there is participation of high school students attending Camp Fiver, a residential summer camp that hosts a group of at-risk students in New York City and rural upstate New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NMR spectrometer enhances research and education at all levels. It impacts research focused on the characterization of synthetic gylcopeptide mimics and photo-caged adenosine receptor ligands. The spectrometer is also used in developing homogeneous transition-metal catalysts and elucidating the structure and dynamics of reactive intermediates. Finally, it benefits the characterization of synthesized porphyrinoids having altered core structures.</AbstractNarration>
