<AbstractNarration>The Internet of Things integrates the virtual world of computers into real-world applications, leading to better efficiency, economy and an improved quality of life. This requires a huge amount of tiny computers, and this project addresses the challenge of powering those computers in a sustainable manner. Tiny computers can run off harvested energy sources such as solar, vibration and/or temperature gradient. The project objective is to show how such energy-constrained devices can support secure and full Internet connectivity. This can be achieved by reworking the computations leading up to a secure Internet connection and spreading them out over time. The proposed solution aims to use every harvested Joule of energy towards useful computations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on insights from three domains, including cryptographic engineering, energy-harvesting technologies, and formal verification. The harvester-friendly version of a cryptographic algorithm is created by partitioning it in pre-computed steps that generate coupons. Coupons are created when there is a surplus energy, and they can be used to speed up online computations at a later phase. The project optimizes cryptography from the standard Internet stack and integrates it with energy-harvester technology. Verification techniques ensure the functional equivalence of pre-computed versions of Internet protocols to their mainstream counterparts. The project contributes to the research agenda in crucial areas such as lightweight cryptography, formal methods, and realization of energy-harvesting systems. The project will disseminate publications, open-source hardware, and software, and it will establish a programming competition to raise the awareness of energy-constraints in the Internet of Things.</AbstractNarration>
