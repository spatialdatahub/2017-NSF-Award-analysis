<AbstractNarration>This award is to support U.S. participants in the International Collaborative Research Group Conference on Geometric Analysis, to be held at the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS), University of British Columbia, Canada from July 24 to July 28, 2017.  Generally speaking, geometric analysis involves using analytic methods to solve problems in differential geometry and general relativity. This workshop will bring together mathematicians, including top experts in the field, to communicate recent progress and to promote interaction and collaboration among the participants.  In particular, the goals of the conference are to disseminate new advances in geometric analysis, to contribute to the training of graduate students, and to bring a large group of mathematicians to exchange and to incubate new mathematical ideas. To realize these goals, junior researchers (including postdoctoral fellows and graduate students) and researchers from various under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply and will be given priority for financial support from the organizing committee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will bring leading experts from all over the world to present the new results and/or surveys of current progresses in geometric analysis, in particular, from the following subfields: (1) Analysis of geometric PDE including curvature flows (e.g., power of Gauss curvature flow, Ricci flow, gradient Ricci solitons, and manifolds with lower Ricci curvature bound); (2) Kahler-Einstein metrics and the Kahler-Ricci flow (e.g., singular Kahler metrics, the Gromov-Hausdorff limits of Kahler manifolds, the regularity and weak solutions of Kahler-Ricci flow, and Kahler-Ricci solitons); (3) Minimal submanifolds and mean curvature flow (e.g., special Lagrangian submanifolds in mirror symmetry, min-max theory from the proof of Willmore conjecture, and the formation of singularities of mean curvature flow); and (4) Mathematical general relativity (e.g., space-like hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature, the center of mass, and the nonlinear gluing approach). Since 2010 PIMS Workshop on Geometric Analysis, there are many exciting new results and new techniques in these fields, and the conference will have about 25 speakers discussing these advances. The abstract of talks and videos from the workshop will be posted on the conference webpage http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-event/170724-ccga</AbstractNarration>
