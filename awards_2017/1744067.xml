<AbstractNarration>This project will use climate model simulations to assist the paleoclimate community with the interpretation of ice core records and provide a valuable, basin-wide paleo history of Pacific climate variability which will be made available to the broader scientific community. Results from this work are expected to reveal how the interactive effects between the underlying background state of the Pacific and individual El Niño/La Niña events have changed over the longer context of Earth's climate history. Thus, enhanced knowledge of Pacific decadal variability and its historical effects on both global and regional climate will help guide precautionary efforts taken to ameliorate their anticipated economic and societal impacts in the future. This team of researchers continuously and consistently disseminate their research results through the Education and Outreach Program at The Ohio State University's Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center, dedicated to providing climate information to students, the public and policymakers at all levels. In addition, this project provides support, training, and mentoring for a female postdoctoral researcher representing the next generation of the scientists in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pacific Ocean surface temperatures oscillate between warm and cold phases every few decades, and these multi-decadal shifts in the background state of the Pacific Ocean affect both regional and global climate. On the regional scale, the underlying warm or cold background state of the Pacific Ocean modulates how individual El Niño/La Niña events affect temperature and precipitation in specific areas. To better predict the impacts of El Niño events on global climate, it is essential to know the background state of the Pacific Ocean. However, our current understanding of this behavior is limited due to relatively short modern instrument observational records. Thus, other methods, such as modeling and/or the use of paleoclimate proxy data, are often used to define Pacific Ocean temperatures prior to the instrumental period. The key goal of this project is to establish a history of Pacific decadal variability and its global climatic influences for the past millennium using a combination of global climate model simulations and readily available ice core records from four different regions around the Pacific Basin. Each ice core provides records of local to global scale climate primarily through annual layer thicknesses (accumulation), stable water isotopic ratios (temperature), and concentrations of both insoluble dust and major anions and cations (atmospheric chemistry). Each record provides distinct insights on precipitation and temperature which will be used to reconstruct the history of basin-wide Pacific variability. The model simulations will serve to improve interpretation of the ice core data and advancing the understanding of underlying mechanisms driving the observed ice core responses to Pacific climate variability. The use of the ice core records also helps evaluate and possibly enhance model capabilities to physically represent critical processes responsible for local climate variability across the Pacific.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
