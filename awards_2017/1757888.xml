<AbstractNarration>This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Mississippi, is located in Oxford, MS. The principal investigators are Nathan Hammer and Gregory Tschumper. The site supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2019-2021. This site, supported by the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical and Physical Science Directorate, offers original research projects in experimental and theoretical physical chemistry. These research projects foster communication and collaboration between members of physical and computational chemistry groups, which increases literacy in high performance computing and its applicability to chemistry. In addition to participating in research, students develop a deeper knowledge in physical chemistry through faculty led lectures on topics like quantum chemistry, molecular spectroscopy, and medicinal chemistry. Students engage in a summer-long schedule of organized professional development and social activities with Ole Miss undergraduate and graduate students, faculty and staff. These activities prepare students for chemistry careers and help to build a network of peers and faculty. To broaden participation and develop a diverse chemistry workforce, this site recruits students from the Southern U.S., particularly those from underrepresented groups in chemistry and from institutions with limited research opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student participants perform original research in the laboratories of faculty members and using the Mississippi Center for Supercomputing Research (MCSR). Centered around experimental and theoretical physical chemistry, the research projects include synthetic design of light-harvesting, photoemissive, and catalytic materials; characterizing the photophysical properties of newly-developed materials; the spectroscopic study and computational modeling of important biologically relevant interactions; and the synthesis and computational modeling of newly-developed materials with important energy or drug development applications. Senior personnel mentor students in original research, present lectures on physical chemistry-related topics, administer mini-courses, and organize social activities. Students in the program gain practical experience in the physical sciences while applying knowledge in chemistry to real world problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
