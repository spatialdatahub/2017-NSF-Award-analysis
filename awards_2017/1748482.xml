<AbstractNarration>This proposal will support U.S. Ph.D. students working in robotics the opportunity to attend a Doctoral Consortium that will enable them to share their knowledge and interact with each other and more senior researchers, to learn about different sub-fields within robotics, to meet potential employers, and to become apprised of new technology that will be demonstrated by vendors. The Doctoral Consortium includes a full day of activities, including poster presentations by students, a panel on how to complete the PhD, and an interactive session on writing an NSF-style proposal.  The proposal partially supports the travel costs for U.S. Ph.D. students to attend the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), which is one of two major international robotics conferences co-sponsored by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society. The conference, which in 2017 is held in Vancouver, Canada, attracts an international crowd that includes academics, industry workers, entrepreneurs, and funding agency leaders.</AbstractNarration>
