<AbstractNarration>Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.  Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics.  This award supports scientists at the University of California Santa Cruz in carrying out gamma-ray astrophysics research using an operating observatory and participating in the planning and development of the next generation gamma-ray observatory.  The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is designed to perform high-sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources.  The University of California Santa Cruz group will work on collection, analysis and interpretation of scientific data from highly-energetic extragalactic sources.  The group will also play a leadership role in the development of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), an international gamma-ray observatory currently in planning stages.  The group plans to develop a citizen science program to engage the public in exploring and analyzing the data from VERITAS.  They will also continue to engage in a broad range of efforts in education and public outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of California Santa Cruz group will use VERITAS to explore the extreme behavior of two powerful classes of gamma-ray sources, active galactic nuclei (AGN) and gamma-ray bursts (GRB).  Measurements of the very high energy gamma-ray emission from AGN probe properties of the AGN jets and provide important information about the acceleration processes.  These data will also be used to study gamma-ray absorption by collisions with the extragalactic background light to test the cosmological model predictions for star formation and galaxy evolution. Using VERITAS data, the group will study GRB mechanisms and the role they play in high energy astrophysical phenomena.  The group will continue efforts to develop the next-generation Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) and will serve in leadership roles within the collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
