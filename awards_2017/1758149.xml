<AbstractNarration>A workshop will be held in Washington, DC on December 7-8, 2017 to plan for the creation of a Data Science Corps. The Data Science Corps will help build the capacity of organizations at the local, state, national and international levels to utilize data to advance science and to help solve social problems. The Data Science Corps would offer practical experiences and teaching opportunities to U.S. data scientists and data science students, who would serve as volunteers working on data science projects in a variety of venues including, academia, industry, government, and various urban and rural communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will bring together a wide variety of stakeholders to discuss the vision and implementation of such a Data Science Corps. It will provide the opportunity to define the organizational and implementation details of the Data Science Corps, and will elaborate upon how the initiative can best serve the volunteers as well as the program beneficiaries. The workshop will include presentations by speakers representing a variety of stakeholders, and will include discussions sessions to help develop ideas for establishment of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Via the Data Science Corps, volunteers--including data science professionals as well as data science students--will be able to offer assistance to real world data science problems, and will provide data science training to users across a wide variety of sectors. By providing assistance to projects in academia, industry, government in communities at the local, state and national levels, Data Science Corps volunteers would gain practical experience on real world data science problems, as well as gain experience as data science teachers and trainers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Data Science Corps program can help enhance existing internship programs at academic institutions by providing a data science theme and focus. The Data Science Corps would complement existing NSF programs, including the Big Data Regional Innovation Hubs, Spokes, and Smart and Connected Communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such a program will help with improved data collection and data analysis across all applications areas, whether in urban or rural communities, and at the local, state, national and international levels. As a result, these communities will have greater capacity to implement data-driven solutions.</AbstractNarration>
