<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Delaware State University (DSU) aims to engage undergraduate students in energy-related interdisciplinary materials science projects in the context of a MakerLab. The project will provide materials chemistry training to chemistry undergraduate students, through annual internships and through undergraduate research projects. The intervention is centered on engaging students traditionally underrepresented and underserved in STEM with the focus of increasing recruitment, retention, graduation rates and job placement in STEM-related fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the project is to implement experiential learning activities in the undergraduate chemistry program by enhancing the integration of education and research in the unique framework of a MakerLab. The specific objectives are to 1) develop MakerLab starter kits towards guiding/facilitating hands-on learning in materials science relevant to energy applications, 2) implement MakerLab learning experiences by offering access to year-round mini-projects integrated as junior research in the undergraduate curriculum, 3) develop curricular enhancements to include lecture and laboratory modules in chemistry courses that apply to the dual offered courses (DSU and Early College High School at DSU) in the Department of Chemistry, 4) organize outreach activities targeted to engage general public awareness of new energy technologies, and 5) disseminate the results of the project by i) promoting adoption of educational materials by peer universities, ii) presenting results to the American Chemical Society Education division symposia, and iii) publishing outcomes of the interventions in peer-reviewed journals. The accomplishment of the project will enhance the institution's ability to create challenging instructional programs.</AbstractNarration>
