<AbstractNarration>Fueled by the growth in cloud computing which serves critical application needs ranging from banking to national defense, data centers have become a critical part of our nation?s infrastructure . Within data centers, servers and the interconnect networks account for an increasingly significant portion of the overall energy. This is because many server farms are configured to operate at a capacity much higher than necessary, and the data movement between servers is rapidly increasing in volume. This project studies the interplay between the servers and networks, and devises energy-saving strategies through monitoring data center workload patterns. With the changing landscape of data center applications and their communication patterns, this research project offers a much-needed study through adopting a holistic view of energy consumed by both servers and networks. The research outcomes will provide direct benefit to US industry through minimizing data center energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates coordinated server-network energy optimization strategies that make judicious use of low-power states available in the processor and network component (micro) architectures while preserving application performance constraints. The solution approach seeks to design workload-specific energy management policies that select an optimal set of low power states and dynamic voltage/frequency settings that are best suited for the workload. To improve power efficiency, power shifting between heterogeneous components will be leveraged such that higher performance can be achieved within a specified power budget. The outcome of this research will include self-adaptive algorithms that will adjust themselves to the changing workload patterns, and techniques that minimize time-to-solution.</AbstractNarration>
