<AbstractNarration>Applications in scientific, industrial, and personal spaces now generate more data than ever before. As data become more abundant and data resources become more heterogeneous, the accessing, sharing and disseminating of data sets becomes a bigger challenge.  Existing technologies for transferring and sharing data suffer from serious shortcomings, including low transfer performance, inflexibility, restricted protocol support, and poor scalability.  This project develops a universal data sharing building block for data-intensive applications, dubbed OneDataShare, with three major goals: (1) optimization of end-to-end data transfers and reduction of the time to delivery of the data; (2) interoperation across heterogeneous and incompatible data resources; and (3) predicting the data delivery time and decreasing the uncertainty in real-time decision-making processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OneDataShare deliverables include: (1) design and implementation of novel algorithms for application-layer optimization of the data transfer protocol parameters to achieve optimal end-to-end data transfer throughput; (2) development of a universal interface specification for heterogeneous data storage endpoints and a framework for on-the-fly data transfer protocol translation; (3) instrumentation of end-to-end data transfer time prediction capability, and feeding it into real-time scheduling and decision-making processes for advanced provisioning, high-level planning, and co-scheduling of resources; (4) deployment of these capabilities as stand-alone OneDataShare cloud-hosted services to end users; and (5) integration of these capabilities with widely used data scheduling and workflow management tools, and validation in specific applications.  OneDataShare services and tools are developed at the application level, and they do not require any changes to the existing infrastructure, nor to the low-level networking stack, although they increase the end-to-end performance of the data movement tasks substantially.  These efficient and high-performance data transfer techniques will help the scientific community, industry, and end-users to save significant time and effort in transferring and sharing data.</AbstractNarration>
