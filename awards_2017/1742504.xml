<AbstractNarration>Open universities enroll an increasing number of students, many of whom have not considered a career in one of the physical sciences. To serve as a model and advance knowledge, this project at Utah Valley University (UVU) will further develop the capacity of a comprehensive open enrollment university with a markedly different student population from those at research-focused institutions.  This project will attract, retain, and graduate students in the physical sciences and prepare them for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professions. The primary aims of the project are to: 1) promote student success and degree completion for academically promising students in the physical sciences of chemistry, earth science and physics at UVU through financial-needs-based scholarships; 2) prepare students for post-graduate education and careers by providing faculty-mentored research experiences and other support services aimed at enriching the education of scholars; 3) increase STEM enrollment and completion in an open-enrollment teaching institution with traditionally low enrollments in STEM disciplines; and 4) advance knowledge of evidence-based practices relative to faculty-mentored research. Questions of interest include (a) close examination of the evolution of student attitudes and abilities for doing science from their uncertain beginnings into those consistent with confident, STEM-career-committed graduates, and (b) the role played by the faculty mentor and student cohort in that process. Project research will focus on which programmatic factors most affect women and other underrepresented groups in STEM. Dissemination of results and research will include publications and presentations at appropriate venues and workshops on evidence-based best practices both locally and in regional discipline-specific educational conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funding from the National Science Foundation's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, over the course of five years this project will provide scholarships for full tuition and books to 50 academically talented and financially needy students in physics, chemistry and earth science baccalaureate degree programs. The interventions are grounded in evidence-based practices and focus on the most essential elements that affect student success. This project builds on the successful components of a Track 1 S-STEM project, including the strength of faculty mentors and student involvement in faculty-mentored research, participation in regional, national, and international conferences, and preparation for and acceptance to graduate school. Based on the evidence of the previous project, this program will ameliorate several institutionally-identified attrition points in the STEM educational pipeline including lengthy time to completion, excessive part-time work, and feelings of isolation by some women students. Exit interviews of students supported in the Track 1 project indicated that the program made a substantial difference in keeping them in school, expanding their vision of science, and giving them a stepping stone to success. It is expected that at the end of the project period at least 90% of students will have received a baccalaureate degree in the physical sciences or be on track to graduate on time.</AbstractNarration>
