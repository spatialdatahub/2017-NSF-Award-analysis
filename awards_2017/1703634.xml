<AbstractNarration>This award constitutes partial support for the Ninth International Congress of Arctic Social Science (ICASS IX), which will be held in June 2017 at Umea University, Umea, Sweden. Since 1992 ICASS has brought together scholars from around the world to share Arctic social science and humanities research. The Congress provides an opportunity to share research methodologies, strategies and results, and promotes international collaboration, not only among scholars, but also between scholars and practitioners. ICASS IX will address Arctic issues, and particularly issues of sustainability and sustainable development in the Arctic, from numerous multi and interdisciplinary standpoints, within the social sciences and humanities, between the social and natural sciences, and including Indigenous knowledge.  All of these approaches will advance new ways of understanding the Arctic, a key region of our changing planet, both in the academic community and among the public. The requested funding will support the participation of early career researchers, Indigenous scholars, as well as northern Indigenous community members. The Congress will foster expanded collaborations between U.S. scholars and social scientists from other Arctic counties and strengthen the leading U.S. role in advancing Arctic social sciences. NSF support will also ensure that Alaska receives a prominent place at the Congress, thus benefitting Alaska scholars, residents and Alaska Native communities in particular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ICASS brings together scholars and other researchers interested in issues of the North. The focus of this Congress will be on "People and Place" and the requested funding will be used to support the participation of early career researchers, Indigenous scholars, northern Indigenous community members, and participants from remote, underrepresented regions. Arctic researchers in the social sciences and humanities have a great responsibility to address the challenges of sustainable development in the Arctic, with a specific focus on the people that live there, including Alaska. ICASS IX will address a broad array of Arctic issues, in particular the issues of sustainability and sustainable development in the Arctic.  Like previous ICASS meetings, this Congress will include a strong focus on Indigenous knowledge and perspectives. The organizers, Andrey Petrov, Diane Hirshberg (members of the organizing committee), and Peter Skold (President of the International Arctic Social Sciences Association) will help build interdisciplinary capacity and scholarship by supporting an increased participation in the Congress scholars representing a broad spectrum of disciplines. This in turn will provide new insights into key areas of concern both from scientists and the public on the long term sustainability of northern development and community well-being.</AbstractNarration>
