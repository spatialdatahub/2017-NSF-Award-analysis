<AbstractNarration>This research project involves acquiring a high-resolution, non-destructive 3-dimensional specimen micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging instrument to study the structure of 3-dimensional biomaterials as well as animal and plant tissues. This state-of-the-art instrument is a state-wide resource available to all researchers across the South Dakota region. The acquired micro-CT significantly enhances the infrastructure and collaborative atmosphere in three research universities, namely the University of South Dakota, South Dakota State University, and South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, as well as the non-profit research organization, Sanford Research. This instrument enables an increased number of successful research projects and the training of future scientists and engineers. This instrument-acquisition project leverages the long-standing state-wide network, enabled by the NSF EPSCoR, the NSF REU, and the NIH IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence programs, to attract new faculty researchers and to inspire young people in STEM studies and careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquired instrumentation enables important studies expected to contribute to the fundamental understanding of the signaling pathways in determination of a variety of tissue development (e.g., bone, blood vessel, tumor and plant root system) and the relationships between the structure and function of materials and tissues. The specific projects enabled by the micro-CT instrument include: 1) Modulation of adult stem cell functions by innovative bone-matrix mimicking 3-dimensional scaffolds; 2) Imaging of novel antibacterial materials for bone repair; 3) Engineering of desensitizing and remineralizing scaffolds in the dentinal tubules of human teeth; 4) Study of the role of Notch signaling pathway in bone development and tumorigenesis; 5) Development of innovative 3D electrospun nanofibrous polymer/mineral composite scaffolds; 6) Identification of the role of miRNAs in soybean nodule development; and 7) Biomechanical investigation of the effect of irradiation therapy on healthy and cancerous bone. Results from these studies form the foundation for the development of innovative biomaterials and new drugs. This award is funded by the Office of Assistant Director of Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
