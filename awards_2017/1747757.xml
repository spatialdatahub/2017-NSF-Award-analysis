<AbstractNarration>The GRid-connected Advanced Power Electronic Systems (GRAPES) center (https://grapes.uark.edu) is focused on research and development of the tools, technologies, and designs of the 21st century modernized electric power grid. This center is led by the University of Arkansas (UA) with two domestic partner institutions: the University of South Carolina and the University of Wisconsin  Milwaukee. The GRAPES center will focus on issues involving renewable integration, microgrid hardware and controls, and fast-acting power conditioning and protection devices that form the basis of the 21st century electric power grid. This work will impact millions in the U.S. through enhanced grid reliability and efficiency, thus lower greenhouse gas emissions. The Center will make full use of an established national-caliber facility for test and evaluation of distribution-level power electronic equipment. This will enable validation of research findings and accelerated insertion of new solid-state equipment into the power grid. GRAPES will train students to develop and manage the next generation of power systems, thereby helping to mitigate the shortage of power engineers. GRAPES will continue to establish new courses that will integrate research with education to produce students not just competitive, but superlative in their ownership of unique skills and knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power electronics enables the integration of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, energy storage, new grid architectures more resilient to natural and man-made attack, and greater efficiency,  all of which reduce greenhouse gas emissions while improving energy security for the nation. A team of highly qualified academic researchers, guided by an industry advisory board, with extensive experience in power systems and power electronics, electronic packaging, semiconductor device modeling, and controls will focus on the design, development, and evaluation of grid-connected power electronic equipment. Examples of such equipment include advanced solid-state transformers, microgrid control methods, novel protection equipment for both ac and dc power distribution, new converter architectures that promote higher efficiencies when interfacing renewable resources to the grid, and fundamental technologies such as new electronic packaging for high voltage applications and semiconductor device models for advanced analysis of power electronic systems. In every case, projects are selected and guided by the industry members of the center to ensure maximum relevance and impact to the industry in either component development, equipment development, or new operational methods for the electric power industry.</AbstractNarration>
