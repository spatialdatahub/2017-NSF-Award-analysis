<AbstractNarration>All computers heavily rely on large and growing memory capacity to handle increasingly diverse, challenging, and data-intensive computation. In order to utilize memory effectively and efficiently, provide high performance, and guarantee security and privacy, computer systems associate memory metadata with all information stored in memory. This metadata stores system-managed information about the data rather than application data directly and is vital for correctness and performance. Storing, accessing, and updating metadata presents unique tradeoff opportunities between metadata cost and performance overheads and the benefits metadata can provide. Conventional approaches have been to couple metadata management with the management of memory itself (in the form of virtual memory) and have evolved very slowly over time.  However, this approach is facing increasing difficulties as computer memory systems evolve to be larger, more heterogeneous, and organized in deeper hierarchies. Such revolutionary memory systems require an equally revolutionary architecture for managing and accessing metadata. This project is researching and exploring such a metadata architecture. This research is sorely needed as both academia and industry are continually finding new uses for metadata but are often left with poor metadata mechanisms that are at the wrong granularity, have too high an overhead on performance, and are too complex to implement. Therefore, the wrong tradeoffs are often made between performance, security, safety, and reliability. The results of this research will directly lead to secure, reliable, performant, and efficient computer systems that provide strong privacy guarantees, which are all crucial to the computing systems both scientists and society in general have come to rely on. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach is to decouple metadata management from data memory management (virtual memory) while exposing metadata management mechanism architecturally to alleviate many of the above limitations. This metadata architecture will be programmable from within the microarchiture and also by system software and provide new levels of flexibility and capabilities. Specifically, the research answers questions on how to: (1) decouple general memory metadata from system-critical translation and protection; (2) coordinate metadata across multiple storage/access mechanisms with different tradeoffs in overhead and granularity; (3) construct expressive yet efficient interfaces for memory metadata; and (4) provide the tools needed by researchers and industry to analyze memory management ideas.</AbstractNarration>
