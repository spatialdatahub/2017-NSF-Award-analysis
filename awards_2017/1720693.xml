<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is based on reduction of catheter-related infections and associated healthcare costs. Central line associated blood stream infections (CLABSI) are extremely dangerous and are associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. Patients with catheters are significantly more likely to develop an infection than those without a catheter. With an average cost of approximately $45k per patient, CLABSI are the most expensive hospital associated infection to treat. Hospitals spend an estimated $1.38 billion treating inpatient infections due to central lines, and Medicare and insurance companies spend an additional $1.7 billion treating outpatient infections from central line catheters in dialysis patients. More broadly, market opportunities for the technology include: sterilization of urinary tract catheters, prevention of catheter based infections in multi-trauma patients such as military personnel, and wound infection treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will evaluate the commercial potential for an antimicrobial wound dressing that exploits the bactericidal effect of blue light to inactivate bacteria commonly colonizing the surface of catheters. The light-emitting catheter dressing is designed to be easily integrated with current standards of care to reduce central line associated blood stream infections. Blue light activates photosensitizers in bacteria, which release reactive oxygen species that are highly cytotoxic by damage of proteins and DNA. Blue light is significantly less harmful to mammalian cells as compared to ultraviolet irradiation, which is commonly used for disinfection of medical facilities, medical devices, water and food. Increasing rates of bacterial resistance indicate the need for infection treatment methods that do not require the use drugs. This device would be marketed to hospitals to reduce cost and patient morbidity and mortality.</AbstractNarration>
