<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), through Targeted Infusion Projects, supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Savannah State University seeks to enhance undergraduate education by implementing an undergraduate certificate program in interdisciplinary data analytics. The project aims to prepare students in data analytics methodologies and tools in their respective disciplines, conduct meaningful research and formulate managerial insights. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and a strong plan for formative and summative evaluation is part of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project reaches across the Colleges of Science and Technology, Business Administration, and Liberal Arts and Social Sciences. The strategies and activities center around three goals which are: to strengthen the curriculum associated with data analytics to enhance student preparedness in data analytic careers; to increase awareness, student enrollment, and retention in data analytics; and to conduct faculty and student development activities that enhance knowledge of data analytical tools and methods. Undergraduate students will work closely with faculty mentors to conduct interdisciplinary research in data analytics. The project has strong industry partners and is expected to address the growing demand for a workforce trained in data analytics.</AbstractNarration>
