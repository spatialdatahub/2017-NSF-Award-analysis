<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site award to the University of North Dakota, located in Grand Forks, ND, supports the training of 10 undergraduate students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2018-2020. The principal investigators are Frank Bowman and Guodong Du. The site is jointly funded by the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences of the Directorate for Geosciences. This REU site focuses on interdisciplinary research at the intersection of chemistry, chemical engineering, and atmospheric sciences. Participants are jointly mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty, providing students unique exposure to a variety of scientific approaches and research challenges. In addition to 10 weeks of intensive research, student participants also receive training in science communication and research conduct, participate in community outreach, and learn about ethics in research.  Particular emphasis is placed on recruiting Native American and first generation students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research projects target renewable and environmental science and engineering, including projects on the development of biodegradable polymers from renewable sources, measurement and modeling of atmospheric processes, and the production of fertilizer from coal and biomass waste streams. Students receive professional development training, particularly in science communication, which teaches participants how to convey science to a general audience. The participants utilize this training in outreach activities for elementary age children, encouraging both the children and the REU participants to pursue science and science-related careers. Emphasis is placed on recruiting first generation and unrepresented minority students, targeting students from primarily undergraduate institutions and Native American tribal colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
