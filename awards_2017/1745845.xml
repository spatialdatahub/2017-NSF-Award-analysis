<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop a new approach for Additive Manufacturing (AM) of objects made from ceramics, metals, and polymers. Developed a generation ago, AM had the potential to transform the design and manufacture of products. However, legacy AM approaches have failed primarily because of the high cost of inputs, and because output lacks precision, quality and durability. Our proposed approach has broad industry potential. The broader societal impact is to change the entire competitive stance of US manufacturing by revolutionizing industrial design and enhancing local manufacturing. This project has the potential to advance science and the prosperity of US manufacturing industries. Its commercial impact may span industries from product design to aerospace, space, defense, and human health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the integrated production of objects made from ceramics, metals, and polymers additively at room temperature from stock inputs such as rods and discs. Over 95% of metallic AM output today uses metallic powders as inputs. These inputs are costly, explosive, and harmful to human health if ingested. Furthermore, current AM output suffers from imprecision, poor quality, inconsistency, and lack of durability. Additionally, legacy Metallic AM platforms are large, expensive, operate at high temperatures, and are isolated from the engineers who rely on them. The key objectives of this project are (1) to demonstrate the feasibility of a room-temperature fabrication approach and (2) to achieve several crucial milestones involving the precision of location, thickness, strength, uniformity and reliability of AM output.</AbstractNarration>
