<AbstractNarration>The incredible advancements of the microelectronics industry over the past 40 years have transformed room-sized super computers of the past into pocket-sized mobile devices of the present; however, the continuation of this incredible progress has slowed significantly as the ultimate limits of the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor -- the workhorse of modern computing, storage, and communication systems -- are reached. Of particular importance is the inability for further energy reduction due to the fundamental physics of how conventional transistors operate. Novel ultra-low-energy transistors could empower a range of new applications -- from long-lasting 'micro-dust' sensors and implantable bioelectronics to cell phones that last a month on a single charge -- driving a new wave of technological innovation. The use of ultra-low-energy transistors in existing applications will decrease energy consumption providing significant economic benefits to society. As part of this work, an online series of short, engaging videos centered on current nanotechnology research will be created to promote science and engineering education to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work seeks to experimentally demonstrate a new type of transistor based on the many-particle physics of Auger generation to overcome the energy limitations of conventional transistors. This 'Auger FET' operates through gate modulation of Auger generation across a semiconductor heterojunction. The scope of the project includes (i) the fabrication of a van der Waals heterostructure comprised of layered two-dimensional materials due to their ability to form super-thin defect-free abrupt heterojunctions that enhance Auger generation and (ii) a theoretical effort to investigate how the geometry and doping of the device structure can be engineered to improve the Auger generation rate. The development of the Auger FET will expand multiple areas of significant scientific research by establishing the foundational physics for an innovative device concept. In doing so, the work will expand understanding of Auger generation and recombination processes in quantum structures, which is critical for improving efficiency in LEDs, lasers, and photodetectors since Auger phenomena decrease their performance.</AbstractNarration>
