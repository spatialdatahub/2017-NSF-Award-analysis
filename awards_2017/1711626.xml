<AbstractNarration>The electronics market is continuing to grow, as functionality of electronic circuits' increases for reduced cost, and the market expands into the developing world with mobile applications. The demand for overall computer and communication infrastructure is also increasing as a result. Electronics became a major driver of the global economy and increased quality of life with reduced device dimensions and integration of new materials and techniques. The recent advances in device technologies is enabling integration of large amount of high-speed data storage with logic circuits to construct computers on chip. If the memory access circuitry can be scaled down, the single-chip computer can significantly outperform the conventional computers in speed, power consumption, cost and size. One of the memory technologies that can enable integration of large data storage with logic circuits is phase change memory, which stores information in the highly resistive amorphous and conductive crystalline states of glassy materials as logic '1's and '0's. Phase change materials can also be used to make a family of multi-contact devices that complement conventional silicon electronics to reduce the area required for the logic circuits. The multi-contact phase change structures that are investigated in this study utilize thermal interactions in addition to electronic interactions to achieve the same or improved functionality at smaller area, reduced power and cost. The graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in device fabrication, characterization, simulations and modeling. The students involved with this project interact with industrial leaders to advance the field of phase change memory and will help transition this multi-contact phase change device technology to mass production. Minority students will be mentored through UConn Mentor Connection and Northeast Alliance program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on fundamental studies on electro-thermal interactions and behavior of phase change materials that enable multi-contact logic devices, and design, fabrication and evaluation of these multi-contact devices as multiplexers, routers, counters, state machines and other logic units.  These devices offer speeds comparable to DRAM (dynamic random access memory) and non-volatile configurations at sufficiently low power levels for critical feature sizes &lt; 50 nm. Pattern transfer technologies to achieve sub-50 nm critical features are now commonly available in silicon CMOS and some of the large-scale manufacturers have announced high density phase change memory products. Hence, the challenges related to integration of phase change memory with CMOS are practically resolved, and new device and circuit concepts that utilize this infrastructure can lead to significant impacts in a relatively short time. These multi-contact phase change devices can be manufactured along with conventional phase change memory arrays atop silicon CMOS to realize logic functions at a significantly reduced transistor count in the CMOS layer.</AbstractNarration>
