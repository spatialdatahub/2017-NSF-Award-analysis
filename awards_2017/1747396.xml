<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the session "EDGE (Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education) Program: Pure and Applied Talks by Women" held at the Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM) in San Diego, CA on Thursday January 11th from 8-10 a.m. and 1-4 p.m. The EDGE program was established in 1998 to empower women, particularly underrepresented minority women, to complete graduate degrees in mathematics and to increase the visibility of women in the mathematical sciences. Since then, hundreds of women have been involved with the EDGE program. This session will showcase mathematical contributions of women who have been affiliated with the EDGE program and will serve as a platform to strengthen the network of women mathematicians.  Graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career faculty will have the opportunity to interact with successful senior female mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To commemorate twenty years since the first summer program was held in 1998, the morning session will feature invited talks by women who participated in one of the early EDGE summer programs, completed PhDs, and have gone on to lead successful careers in the mathematical sciences. The afternoon session will feature contributed talks by graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and early career mathematicians who have also been involved in the EDGE program.
