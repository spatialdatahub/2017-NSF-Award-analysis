<AbstractNarration>An award is made to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) to purchase a super-resolution microscope (Leica STED) that will serve as the super-resolution center in the New York Capital Region. This project will impact many layers of our society. First, information about STED microscopy and its applications will be incorporated in several courses (Methods in Biophysics BCBP4800-RPI; Bio513 Modern Use of Light Microscopy-SUNY; Bioimaging AMC 608; Learn, Design, Teach Nanotechnology RPI MTLE 4960; Microscopy and Analysis "Tools"-Wadsworth Center). It will be part of the CBIS Annual Hands-On Workshops. It will be part of the Biological Sciences Seminar Series at all four institutions. Second, it will be incorporated in community outreach programs to encourage students into STEM fields: Black Family Technology Awareness Day; the High School Summer Research Program and the LSAMP Summer Research Program; the annual Science, Technology, Arts, and Architecture at Rensselaer Program that reaches out to talented underrepresented minorities and young women. Third, information about this technology and the research that it enables, including in nontraditional fields, will be distributed throughout the region's biotechnology community via Bioconnex, a network dedicated to the development of partnerships between research, education and business in the NY Capital region. Fourth, one of the RPI "Public Interest Research Forums" will be dedicated to STED and will establish the connection between this cutting-edge technology, the Nobel prize and implications to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is the research activities that are enabled through the application of simulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy. STED microscopy creates super-resolution images by the selective deactivation of fluorophores, minimizing the area of illumination, and thus, bypassing the diffraction limit of conventional light microscopy.  The microscope will enable very interdisciplinary research: 25 investigators across four institutions are strongly supporting this application, representing fourteen different Departments/Centers.  Areas of research enabled include the study of cellular adherens and cellular permeability, STEM cell research, smooth muscle cell development, intracellular molecular interactions, endothelial cell development, and functional characterization of presynaptic terminals at small central synapses.  The critical need for this technology and the diverse research applications for the instrument demonstrate that the super resolution microscope will become an extraordinary regional resource. Knowledge accumulated as a result of using STED imaging will have a tremendous positive impact in the fields of biological sciences, materials characterization and tissue engineering in the greater New York Capital Region.</AbstractNarration>
