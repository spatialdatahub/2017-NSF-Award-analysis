<AbstractNarration>Despite its promise, the full benefits of spider silk have yet to be harnessed as all previous spinning techniques have resulted in inferior synthetic fibers. While the natural underlying chemical structure and fiber production of spider silks have co-evolved over millions of years, synthetic silk fiber production devices do not mimic the biological process and are plagued by inconsistency because of (1) a simplified spinning process, and (2) shorter and incomplete protein/polymers used in spinning. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award will support the generation of data to demonstrate the feasibility of mimicking the natural silk spinning process using additive manufacturing to produce consistent, high-performance, silk-based fibers of length. This award will enable fundamental research to provide needed knowledge for the commercial development of spider silk and other high performance micron-scale fibers. The new process will enable predictable diameter silk fibers for use in automotive, military, biomedical, and other commercial endeavors to be produced via shear thinning. Therefore, results from this research will benefit the U.S. economy and society. This research involves several disciplines including mechanical engineering, cell and molecular biology, control theory, and materials science and will help broaden participation of underrepresented groups, integrating multiple students in research and positively impacting engineering education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although major ampullate spider silk has been sought after for its characteristic strength and toughness for decades, production of the fiber has been hampered by inconsistency. Recently, new knowledge about the spider's black box silk production has been obtained, providing important insight into high-performance fiber production. A combination of chemical environment and mechanical forces are necessary to produce high-performance, micron-scale fibers. Previous efforts have not provided this combination and have produced fibers with inferior mechanical properties. The advent of additive manufacturing and microfluidics will allow both the shear forces as well as the chemical environment (i.e., pH or ionic gradient) of the spider's biological silk spinning system to be mimicked, representing a significant departure from the current dogma of the field. This research will establish a predictable correlation between the genetic sequence of the protein, the chemical environment of the spin dope, and the mechanical shear necessary for protein polymerization and silk production. The research team will produce (1) an immortalized spider silk gland cell line as a steady source of silk proteins, (2) micron-sized silk fibers with consistent diameter, (3) mechanically-tailored and predictable fibers based on alterations of mechanical shear.</AbstractNarration>
