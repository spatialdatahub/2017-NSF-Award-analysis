<AbstractNarration>The SALG instrument [Student Assessment of their Learning Gains] is a web-based software system that allows faculty instructors to register their courses and require or request their students to log into the system to answer questions about the course, specifically the learning components of the course such as course technology, textbook, lectures, labs, discussions, and group projects. It can be used for formative assessment about the design of the course as well as an end of the semester course evaluation. It can be used repeatedly during a semester for both formative and summative assessment of the course.  The SALG site was designed and put into operation through an earlier NSF award. The site provides a very easy to use service to its users. It summarizes student survey responses and emails the results back to instructor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current project is a salvage operation, designed to move the current platform from one programming language to a more current language (PERL to JAVA). Except for this change, the maintenance of the SALG web site continues to be at the expense of the PI and his team. There is an installed base of 10,000 instructor users who depend on this tool and new users are added every semester.</AbstractNarration>
