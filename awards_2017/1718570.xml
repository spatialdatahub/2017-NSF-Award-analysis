<AbstractNarration>As the semiconductor industry reaches 10nm/7nm technology nodes and beyond, more innovations will be realized through alternative or emerging scaling such as novel process/material and device engineering to seek equivalent scaling effects. Such scaling demands closer design and technology co-optimization and explorations. This project will seek to develop novel CAD algorithms, tools, and methodologies to bridge the future IC design and technology gaps in the new era of emerging scaling. The proposed research, if successful, will have tremendous impacts on the $350 billion semiconductor industry which is at a critical point, transitioning from conventional scaling to emerging scaling. The PI will work with industry collaborators for technology transfer to benefit the overall industry and society. The highly interdisciplinary nature of this research will be tightly integrated into curriculum development and student training/outreach activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical problems to be addressed include: (1) new sub-resolution directed-self-assembly (DSA) patterning and layout co-optimizations; (2) new mask and layout optimizations for future hybrid lithography technologies considering emerging processes/materials and design requirements; (3) future standard cell and routing architecture exploration; (4) physical design for next-generation nano-devices.</AbstractNarration>
