<AbstractNarration>1703549 Asatekin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Membranes form a permeable barrier, allowing select molecules to pass into a product stream while retaining unwanted compounds. Membrane technology is crucial for purification of many substances, including water treatment, production of biological products, and food and beverage processing. Despite this diversity of applications, commercial membranes are currently made of only a handful of polymer chemistries, leaving an opportunity for development of materials that may provide greater selectivity or higher throughput, thereby increasing productivity of the purification. Of particular interest are hydrogel polymers, which unlike conventional polymers, are hydrophilic, and this opens up new applications and may increase performance by decreasing membrane fouling. The aim of this project is to develop a new, scalable method for forming thin hydrogel membranes that can incorporate a broad range of chemistries and functional nanomaterials, enabling greater productivity in purification of water and biomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop an approach to form very thin, defect-free hydrophilic selective layers on membranes by free-radical interfacial polymerization. The interfacial tension between an aqueous and organic layer creates a uniform and continuous interface for polymerization. Water-soluble monomers will be polymerized by an initiator with limited aqueous solubility, which will control the thickness of the film. A range of multi-functional materials will be used to control selectivity. Design principles for a robust and scalable process will be established via variation of monomer concentration, chemistry, and polymerization conditions. Embedded functional groups will anchor integrated bio-templated catalytic nanoparticles, which will be for simultaneous deactivation of contaminants. All resulting materials will be characterized and tested for selectivity and catalytic deactivation. The project will impact polymer and membrane science, nanobiotechnology, and catalytically functionalized materials. The new materials will enable efficient water treatment and environmental cleanup. The PI and co-PI will mentor graduate students, incorporate this research in their teaching and into core lab classes, and design new outreach activities and videos for the general public that feature key aspects of the research.</AbstractNarration>
