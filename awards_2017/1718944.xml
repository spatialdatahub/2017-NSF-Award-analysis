<AbstractNarration>This project will analyze, model and synthesize human behaviors to create a believable Conversational Agent (CA). A CA is a virtual agent that interacts with a user, displaying human-like behaviors not only through speech but also through facial expressions and head movements. Replicating or representing human behavior includes generating gestures that are synchronized with speech, convey appropriate meaning in the message, and respond to the behaviors displayed by the user. An appealing approach to synthesize human-like behaviors is the use of data-driven methods, which have the potential of capturing naturalistic variations of the behaviors. Modeling the dependencies between speech and gestures brings insights about verbal and nonverbal communication, underlying the production and coordination mechanisms used during natural human interactions. CAs can be used in a variety of health care applications, such as helping hearing impaired individuals and teaching social skills to autistic children. Tutoring systems that display human-like behaviors to communicate and acknowledge active listening will engage better with the students, helping them in their learning. The project promises a fertile ground for interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students. The models will be evaluated with an assistive agent (CA or embodied robot) interacting with UT Dallas students, serving as a platform to reach out students from all majors, especially woman and underrepresented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will take an integrative, cross-disciplinary approach to generate believable and meaningful behaviors by exploring the intrinsic relation between speech, head motion, and facial expressions, constrained by important aspects of spoken language. The planned research leverages some of the latest developments in the field of deep learning in an integrative fashion, pulling together acoustic features and semantic language structure, to build models that are able to account for the correlation between various facial and head movements. The speech-driven approach will capture the variability of human behavior in a manner that is not easily possible with rule-based approaches. Dialog acts and emotions will be inferred and used to constrain the speech driven models, capturing the relation between high-level conversational functions and facial gestures. The project will offer novel, principled methods to generate behaviors driven by synthesized speech, opening new application domain when only text is available. The approach will capture the acoustic variability in synthesized speech, while maintaining the temporal dependency between gestures and speech. The project will also explore schemes to modify the behaviors of the user by displaying carefully designed gestures generated with our data-driven framework. By tracking the behaviors of the user, the system will provide appropriate responses, closing the loop in the interaction.</AbstractNarration>
