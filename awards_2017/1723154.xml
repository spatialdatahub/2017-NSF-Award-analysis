<AbstractNarration>Water is the basis for life on this planet, making aquatic ecosystems some of the most critical in the world, but they are also the most imperiled.  ND-LEEF is a globally unique field site where scientists and engineers can find solutions to some of our greatest environmental challenges, especially threats to aquatic systems. The facility represents a unique combination of interconnected streams, ponds, and wetlands in the form of experimental watersheds. Researchers can manipulate ecosystem types, individually or linked, while still being embedded within the natural environment that bridges a critical gap between laboratory and field scales. Set within a local park in St Joseph County (IN), ND-LEEF's location facilitates access to the public and allows for meaningful research translation and outreach. In four years, programming has reached &gt;1400 individuals, including 800 local k-12 children. This project will maximize the scientific, education and outreach potential of ND-LEEF by identifying potential users, roadblocks that may be limiting current use, and help develop a plan to overcome hurdles to maximize the impact and efficiency of ND-LEEF. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to create a five-year strategic plan for ND-LEEF to inform further infrastructure growth, identify potential users, draw these users to ND-LEEF, facilitate regional scientific collaborations, provide a platform for undergraduate education and enhanced local STEM outreach. The plan will include identification of potential users within a 150-mile driving distance. The project team will conduct interviews to identify barriers for usage, and identify strategies to increase use by researchers and their students.  The project includes a one-day regional workshop for current and identified potential researchers/educators that will (i) explore the growth potential of ND-LEEF in greater detail, (ii) identify required novel infrastructure, (iii) identify current barriers to use, (iv) promote regional collaboration across research and educational interests, and (v) lay the groundwork for growing an ND-LEEF community.</AbstractNarration>
