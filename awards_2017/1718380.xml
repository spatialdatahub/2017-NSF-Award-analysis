<AbstractNarration>Developing approaches to subjects as diverse as advertising, bioinformatics, counterterrorism, fraud detection, politics, sociology, and so on are based on data analysis. This project will develop new algorithms for data analysis with strong guarantees of their correctness and efficiency. Tools based on these algorithms will be usable as-is, without expert knowledge, in innovative data-driven applications far removed from academia. The project will also involve the training of students in advanced techniques for data analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The algorithms considered in this project involve automated reasoning with an algebraic logic known as "sum-of-squares." Automated reasoning requires a delicate trade-off between expressiveness and simplicity, to facilitate reasoning that is both fast and effective. Sum-of-squares is capable of expressing much statistical reasoning, and yet is sufficiently simple to allow the design of tractable algorithms for reasoning. This project will consider how these algorithms can be used to reason about an overall distribution or population from a sample of data drawn from it. The main aim of the project is to develop efficient algorithms that guarantee that all of the relevant statistical facts are discovered during data analysis. The project will further develop these algorithms to solve problems in domains such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the development of domain-specific algorithms, the project will consider sum-of-squares reasoning with high-degree polynomials. Although such reasoning in the standard sense is intractable, the project aims to simulate reasoning with such high-degree expressions with the aid of the sample of data from the distribution to be reasoned about. The project will also investigate the expressive power of sum-of-squares with such high-degree expressions. Specifically, the project will investigate whether or not such reasoning can simulate other logics such as resolution (or vice-versa), and will further investigate the extent of its ability to basic capture statistical notions.</AbstractNarration>
