<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Savannah State University (SSU) seeks to develop a new applied math minor and make curricular improvements to upper level math courses that will strengthen the applied math focus. This project is aimed at improving the quality of math teaching and learning in upper level courses by offering the minor through an applied math, active learning focus. By engaging and inspiring students, the minor will increase enrollment in upper level math courses, and provide SSU STEM majors with the mathematical problem-solving skills demanded in the increasingly data-driven 21st century job market. The project is expected to strengthen the mathematical knowledge and capabilities and increase retention, graduation, and entry into competitive STEM jobs by minority applied math minors and other SSU graduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching project goal is to establish a sustainable minor program in Applied Mathematics, and thereby increase undergraduate STEM enrollment, retention, graduation and entry into STEM jobs and graduate programs. The specific goals are to 1) increase interest and enrollment in math fields, 2) strengthen math teaching and learning and develop students' mathematical knowledge and problem solving capabilities, 3) strengthen connections to STEM careers, and 4) strengthen pipelines from K-12 to college math programs. The project will generate new knowledge and evidence on how an applied math minor program which includes interdisciplinary problems and an active learning approach will strengthen the mathematical problem solving skills and competencies of underrepresented minority students and their qualifications for competitive STEM jobs and graduate programs.</AbstractNarration>
