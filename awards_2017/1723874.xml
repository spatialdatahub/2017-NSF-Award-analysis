<AbstractNarration>This project is investigating factors that affect the formation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the atmosphere.  Factors such as particle size and composition can influence the ability of a particle to uptake water and become a cloud droplet.  This research will improve understanding of the interactions between aerosols and clouds, that are the most uncertain aspect of the climate system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative effort focuses on quantifying the contribution of phase, morphology, and mixing state to CCN activation and droplet formation at subsaturated and supersaturated conditions.  The project has the following objectives: (1) Compare hygroscopicity measurements with traditional hygroscopicity predictions for particles with different phase states; (2) Define the role of particle morphology (specifically changes in phase-separating systems) for particle water-uptake; (3) Determine the effect of particle mixing state of varying two-component phase systems for hygroscopicity; and (4) Develop models and software to interpret mixed phase state and morphology CCN activation curves.  The collaboration includes a diverse group of early career scientists and will support the participation of both graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
