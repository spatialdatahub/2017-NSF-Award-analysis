<AbstractNarration>The International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC) to be held in Columbus, Ohio on July 17-21, 2017.  The conference is the leading conference on autonomic computing techniques, foundations, and applications.  The conference covers a wide range of topics that impacts the core of Computer Network and Systems Research (CNS).  This includes but are not limited to data centers, cloud computing, smart cities, cyber-physical systems, sensors, and embedded systems, which are all applications for autonomic computing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference focuses on exposing the state of the art in the area of autonomic computing systems that reduce the burden of large unwieldy systems by allowing the systems to more effectively manage their own behavior in ways that maximizes performance and minimizes cost reliably and securely. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ICAC 2017 will offer many opportunities for students to meet, interact, and exchange ideas in both a formal and an informal atmosphere to ensure that students and experts interact. It is important for the US to remain engaged and competitive in this area.  This grant will fund US graduate and undergraduate students who would not normally be able to attend.</AbstractNarration>
