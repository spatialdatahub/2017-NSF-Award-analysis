<AbstractNarration>Magnetic fields in the stars and planets are common features in the universe.  The individual properties of these magnetic fields vary widely, however, among all of these different objects. In our own Solar System, the Sun's magnetic field has a well-defined, periodic reversal of polarity every 22 years.  In contrast, the Earth undergoes magnetic field polarity reversals that are irregular in timing.  All planets in the Solar System except Mars and Venus have active magnetic fields, and Mars was once home to a relatively strong magnetic field.  Magnetic fields have also been observed in other stars.   Research into the causes of magnetic field polarity reversals can produce results affecting the forecasting of solar flares, as well as understanding the space environment that will affect human exploration beyond the Earth's orbit.  The investigators will develop and use new software tools to advance our understanding of polarity reversals.  The Principal Investigator and a graduate student will lead this project, which will also make many opportunities for undergraduates to join in the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will develop novel dynamo modeling analysis tools and incorporate them into a well-understood and highly efficient magnetohydrodynamic code to advance our understanding of polarity reversals in new dynamical regimes. These tools will allow for a multiscale analysis of polarity reversals, and enable a precise characterization of the physical processes at work in the two reversal regimes observed to date. This research has the potential to significantly alter the current view of dynamo physics by conducting one of the most detailed numerical analyses to date of the equations governing natural dynamos.</AbstractNarration>
