<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating magnetic resonance imaging-guided robotics technology to develop a robotic catheter system for treatment of atrial fibrillation ablation.  The developed technology aims to improve treatment of atrial fibrillation, which has an estimated the prevalence of 2.7-6.1 million in the United States, with 200,000 new cases annually.  The developed real-time, magnetic resonance, imaging-guided, robotic catheter technology will significantly improve the accuracy and repeatability of the atrial fibrillation ablation therapy, compared to the state-of-the-art manually controlled catheters.  This technology will also reduce costs by decreasing time in the operating room, reducing the need for repeat procedures due to incomplete treatment, and reducing adverse events and complications.  In this project, the investigators will develop a proof-of-concept prototype of the robotic catheter system that will be used in subsequent early validation studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the technology gaps in synergistically integrating high-speed magnetic resonance imaging technologies with robotic motion planning and control techniques, to develop a novel co-robotic system.  In the proposed paradigm, the atrial fibrillation ablation will be performed under intra-operative magnetic resonance imaging guidance, and conventional manually controlled intravascular catheters will be replaced with robotic catheters actuated by the magnetic resonance imaging system. The location of the catheter tip and the target tissue will be measured by magnetic resonance imaging in real-time. The robotic control algorithms will then use this information to actively control the catheter tip. Intra-operative availability of magnetic resonance imaging, with its superior tissue discrimination capabilities, would allow real-time evaluation of the substrate depth and lesion created by ablation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, personnel involved in this project, in particular, one postdoctoral and one graduate student, will receive training in innovation and technology commercialization through participating in technology innovation and entrepreneurship education programs.</AbstractNarration>
