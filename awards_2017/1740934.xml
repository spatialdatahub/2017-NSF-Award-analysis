<AbstractNarration>Every two years, the Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference brings together leading members of the scientific community, graduate students, postdocs, and early career scientists to discuss new, cutting-edge research projects in marine chemistry within an informal setting. The National Science Foundation, along with the Gordon Research Conference, will co-sponsor the participation of at least 15 graduate students/postdocs/early career scientists and 30 invited speakers/discussion leaders/chairs to the 2017 Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2017, the Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference will be held July 23-28, 2017 at Colby Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire. The theme for the conference will be "Synthesizing Multifaceted Data in Chemical Oceanography" with the aim of highlighting new approaches available in the field of chemical oceanography to address cutting edge questions.  The primary goal of the conference is to provide a forum that brings together scientists that are leading contributors in the field of marine chemistry along with graduate students and postdocs to exchange ideas on new, innovative research. Presentations and discussions at the 2017 Gordon Conference will center around the following session topics: (1) Time Series- Synthesizing Observations over Space and Time; (2) Autonomous Measurements-Filling Gaps in the Space/Time Continuum; (3) New Perspectives on the Biological Pump; (4) Multi-Element Approaches to Chemical Oceanography; (5) Data Assimilation and Synthesis Through Ocean Models; (6) Coupled Biogeochemical Cycles; (7) Organic Geochemistry-Identifying Sources and Cycling of DOM; (8) Sediment Processes-Scaling up from Local to Global Scales; and (9) Paleoceanography-Integrating Measurements Across Space and Time.  The Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference has become recognized as an important venue to exchange ideas in the interdisciplinary field of marine chemistry and to forge new scientific alliances.</AbstractNarration>
