    <AbstractNarration>The United States economy is increasingly reliant on highly skilled information technology professionals who not only have excellent foundational computer knowledge, skills, and abilities, but also possess the cybersecurity skills required to protect and defend the critical national cyber resources on which business and industry rely. To address the demand of business and industry for these professionals, North Arkansas College (Northark) has designed this project to increase the number of skilled technicians who are trained in network technology with a cybersecurity focus. The project team will enhance and expand their program by infusing the existing Information Technology/Network Systems Administration curricula with cyber security components. The Business/Industry Leadership Team (BILT) at the college will play an active role in setting the direction of the IT program as they have an increased need for more highly trained skilled technicians in IT/Cyber. The project will assist in diversifying the workforce and growing the economy in rural areas by providing access to high-tech jobs for low income students. The results of this project will be life changing and will provide a pathway out of poverty for many students and their families. Northark will share all aspects of the project, including newly developed methods of engaging Business and Industry (the BILT model), methods to offer course materials remotely, strategies to recruit and provide access to rural students, and curricular improvements, on a website devoted to this project and at in-state, regional, and national conferences. A comprehensive evaluation will determine which components of the project are most effective and where modifications are needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because many residents in the service area of the college and other parts of Arkansas, especially those in rural areas, do not have access to the resources required, Northark will utilize technology to support remote delivery of course content through web and virtual options, as well as expanded face to face opportunities at satellite locations and high schools. It will also create a concurrent credit track to allow high school students to complete an IT/Cyber Certificate of Proficiency, actively recruit rural and high school students to enter this high tech field, and add an Academic/Career coach who will provide support that will increase retention, degree completion, and job placement. Using available NSF-ATE curriculum and open source materials, faculty at the college will adapt and enhance the existing IT program with Cybersecurity topics and adapt all curricula for distance delivery. Northark will pilot test distance delivery of this high tech coursework to rural students who do not otherwise have access to such curricular opportunities. The program will be promoted by BILT members and current students and the college will utilize recruiting strategies adapted from other ATE projects to attract more students to this updated flexibly-delivered program.</AbstractNarration>
