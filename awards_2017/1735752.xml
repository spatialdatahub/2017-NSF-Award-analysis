<AbstractNarration>Writing and revising are essential parts of learning, yet many college students graduate without&lt;br/&gt;demonstrating improvement or mastery of academic writing. This project explores the feasibility&lt;br/&gt;of improving students' academic writing through a revision environment that integrates natural&lt;br/&gt;language processing methods, best practices in data visualization and user interfaces, and&lt;br/&gt;current pedagogical theories. The environment will support and encourage students to develop&lt;br/&gt;self-regulation skills that are necessary for writing and revising, including goal-setting, selection&lt;br/&gt;of writing strategies, and self-monitoring of progress. As a learning technology, the environment&lt;br/&gt;can be applied on a large scale, thereby improving the writing of diverse student populations,&lt;br/&gt;including English learners. Additionally, the project's multidisciplinary training of graduate&lt;br/&gt;students is focused on increasing diversity in cyberlearning research and development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three stages of investigation are planned. First, to analyze data on students' revision behaviors,&lt;br/&gt;a series of experiments are conducted to study interactions between students&lt;br/&gt;and variations of the revision writing environment. Second, the collected data forms the gold&lt;br/&gt;standard for developing an end-to-end system that automatically extracts revisions between&lt;br/&gt;student drafts and identifies the goal for each revision. Multiple extraction algorithms are&lt;br/&gt;considered, including phrasal alignment based on semantic similarity metrics and deep learning&lt;br/&gt;approaches. To identify the goal of a revision, a supervised classifier is trained from the gold&lt;br/&gt;standard. A diverse set of features and the representations of the identified goals (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;granularity, scope) are explored. In addition to the "extract-then-classify" pipeline, an alternative&lt;br/&gt;joint sequence labeling model is also developed. The labeling of sequences is used to&lt;br/&gt;recognize revision goals and the sequences are mutated to generate possible corrections of&lt;br/&gt;sentence alignments for revision extraction. The writing environment is iteratively refined,&lt;br/&gt;augmenting the interface prototyping through frequent user studies. Third, a complete&lt;br/&gt;end-to-end system that integrates the most successful component models is deployed in&lt;br/&gt;college-level writing classes. Student progress is tracked across multiple assignments.</AbstractNarration>
