<AbstractNarration>This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project aims to create and experiment with a smart phone app that enables access by non-experts to manufacturing services. Currently, most design and engineering tools to accomplish such tasks are expensive, difficult to learn and cumbersome to use. These impediments have limited the availability of manufacturing services to non-specialists, thereby limiting their creativity in product innovation. The results from this research will give new insights into the requirements for the evolution of a network-based manufacturing service delivery system to benefit the U.S. economy, small and medium-sized manufacturers and society.  High school and university students and industry organizations will be engaged in experimentation with the system and the establishment of a cyber community to foster innovation. Other activities planned include demonstrations at high schools, universities and technical conferences. This interdisciplinary project will involve the manufacturing engineering, computer science and mechanical engineering disciplines and will create new learning modules to introduce students in those disciplines to concepts involving use of virtual reality tools and environments to create 3D-based interactive environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research involves the design, creation and validation of a next generation cybermanufacturing software to allow users from a cross-section of backgrounds to design and build parts interactively using a virtual reality environment. A core functionality will be accessibility and simplicity in modifying a given design. Unlike cumbersome computer-aided design (CAD) tools, this smart phone-based app will allow users to interact intuitively in a 3D environment, where they can modify existing designs using a touch screen interface on a smart phone or tablet; a base set of designs will be provided for making consumer and household items. The interface will operate on an android platform, be made available to the public, and encourage non-expert users to easily access manufacturing services.</AbstractNarration>
