<AbstractNarration>With funding from the National Science Foundation's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, the Renewable Energy Materials Scholars STEM (REMS-STEM) project is providing support to low-income students with demonstrated financial need and academic promise to succeed in STEM disciplines at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). REMS-STEM will contribute to the important work of providing new pathways for students entering the STEM workforce with undergraduate degrees.  Specifically, this project will provide scholarships to 20 low-income, academically-talented, underrepresented students who transfer from community colleges to WPI to complete bachelor's degrees in the field of renewable energy materials. Expected outcomes of this S-STEM Track 2 project include an exemplary degree attainment rate for REMS-STEM scholars (90% in two years and 100% in three years)and an increase in the number of low-income students who attain employment or pursue graduate research in a clean energy technology field.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the project is to overcome the known barriers to community college students in completing a four-year degree in STEM education. REMS-STEM will provide wrap-around support services to funded students, including: a combined approach towards curriculum enrichment; applied research opportunities; hierarchical mentoring; and career-development services. The REMS-STEM program will provide enhanced career development support by including entrepreneurial mindset training through a student-centered pedagogy and by facilitating the access of REMS-STEM scholars to a network of national and regional partnerships. The project will rely on existing WPI support systems but also provide a significant faculty mentoring program for REMS-STEM scholars. The project will produce knowledge about the effectiveness of the supports for the S-STEM scholars, particularly in the area of mentoring, where the faculty will mentor advanced students who will mentor early undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
