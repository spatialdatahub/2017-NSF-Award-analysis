<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for an international conference on "Interviewers and Their Effects from a Total Survey Error Perspective." The conference will be held in February 2019 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The conference will focus on the study of interviewers as a source of survey error and the implications of research on this topic for survey practice. It will bring together up to 50 scholars from the US and other countries. The conference will produce results important to survey methodology and related social science fields and will develop a research agenda on interviewer effects, including best practices for studying and training interviewers. It will further pedagogical goals by clearly delineating study design and estimation approaches for the study of interviewer effects, and it will foster the entrance of junior scholars, graduate students, and new researchers to this important area. By bringing together established scholars, students, and practitioners from academia, government, and industry, this conference will permit immediate translation of findings into survey practice, will build research infrastructure, and will improve the quality of survey data collected by interviewers. Conference presentations will be widely disseminated. They will be made available in a publicly accessible archive, published in an edited volume from a scientific press, and developed into a short course for professional associations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers will come to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln during Spring 2019 to participate in a three-day interdisciplinary conference.  The conference will include a mix of research presentations and discussion. The goal of the conference is to provide a forum for academic, government, and industry researchers and practitioners to discuss methods, practical insights, and research findings on interviewers. The major themes of the conference will be synthesizing and expanding knowledge about the impact of interviewers on multiple error sources, evaluating and disseminating study design and estimation approaches for studying interviewers, and integrating evidence from research and practice to produce an agenda for future studies of interviewers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
