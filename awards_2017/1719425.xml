<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), through Targeted Infusion Projects, supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore seeks to enhance undergraduate physics education by implementing innovative, yet evidence-based strategies and activities to teach physics. The project includes a strong plan for formative and summative evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the goal to improve student engagement in physics classrooms by introducing peer-to-peer instruction, by synchronization between labs and lectures, by using a non-traditional approach as an engagement tool through novel instructional materials, and by integrating the materials to clicker questions for real-time, in-class feedback and assessment of learning outcomes. The project establishes a faculty and graduate teaching assistants training program in active learning methods in group settings; implements active learning techniques in selected physics courses;  creates a pool of culturally and scientifically relevant clicker questions to enhance both engagement and critical thinking; and measures the effects of implementation and challenges as they arise. This project will serve as a case study on how to implement evidence-based teaching methods in the setting of this institution, which can then serve as a model at other institutions of similar mission and size.</AbstractNarration>
