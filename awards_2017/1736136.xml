<AbstractNarration>Center for Next Generation Multifunctional Composites&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program supports the enhancement of research capabilities of minority-serving institutions through the establishment of centers that effectively integrate education and research. CREST promotes the development of new knowledge, enhancements of the research productivity of individual faculty, and an expanded presence of students historically underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With CREST program support, Southern University and A&amp;M College in Baton Rouge will continue development of its Next Generation Multifunctional Composites Center in collaboration with Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge Community College and industrial partners. This work will have a significant impact on the design and synthesis of polymer based materials for biological and technical applications The increased use of composites in applications, such as automotive, naval, aerospace, energy generation, and transportation vehicles, where light weight, damage tolerance, and multifunctionality are major factors, highlights the need for materials research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center will promote advancements in polymer matrix composite materials synthesis and characterization, modeling and simulation, and manufacturing for structural and environmental applications. Center research is divided into three subprojects. Subproject I will contribute to the understanding of 1) Design, synthesis, and characterization of high stiffness shape memory thermoset polymer with dynamic covalent bond exchange network for intrinsic crack healing; 2) Modeling and manufacturing of polymeric artificial muscles made of chemically cross-linked two-way shape memory polymers; and 3) Healing efficiency evaluation of composite panels. In Subproject 2, knowledge of a new and highly energy efficient method for large scale synthesis of carbon nanotubes will be created. The new synthesis method can be used for mass production of carbon nanotubes at much lower production cost than production by prevailing methods such as chemical vapor deposition. In Subproject 3, the focus is on creating knowledge via computational material design for the study of additive manufacturing of smart conductive polymer nanocomposites with multi-scale porosity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of cutting edge interdisciplinary research based on next generation composites and educational activities through this Center will provide students traditionally underrepresented in the STEM disciplines with meaningful research experiences at a readily accessible advanced research facility and a pathway to Ph.D. programs. The Center will provide education and research integration and exposure to students from K-16 to the doctoral level, and to the general public, including persons with disabilities. Overall, each year the Center will directly support 3 postdoctoral fellows, 3 Ph.D. students, 9 Master's students, and 18 undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
