<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This project supports research at the University of Pittsburgh aimed at the discovery of a new class of quantum states and means to control them. This work helps bring about fault-tolerant topological quantum computing which is designed around braiding. Braiding is the physical exchange of positions of yet to be demonstrated non-Abelian anyon quasiparticles. These are particles that alter their quantum states upon exchnage, making them distinct from already known bosons and fermions. The most basic predicted non-Abelian anyon is a Majorana quasiparticle which is a quantum superpoisition of electron and its antiparticle. This project aims to perform the braiding experiment in a network of semiconductor nanowires connected to superconductors, a device in which evidence of Majorana quasiparticles has been obtained previously. The braiding experiment can be used to verify the non-Abelian anyon nature of Majorana quasiparticles and pave the way to topological quantum bits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the physical exchange, or braiding, of Majorana bound states generated at high magnetic fields in indium antimonide semiconductor nanowires epitaxially coupled to aluminum superconductors. The outcome of this work will help establish a new class of fundamental excitations, the non-Abelian anyons, and demonstrate a new type of a quantum bit that takes advantage of topological protection of quantum information. Magnetic flux-based approach to manipulating as well as detecting Majorana bound states is used in this research. The project includes training a postdoctoral researcher in advanced nanofabrication and low temperature measurements, as well as in the fundamental physics of non-Abelian anyons.</AbstractNarration>
