<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical description: Materials are so essential to societal advance that early civilizations are often named after a particular material (e.g. "Bronze age' and "Iron age"). Pivotal materials at the foundation of our modern civilization are far too diverse to name just a few. Electronics and photonics, nevertheless, capture the key technologies and industries that influence every aspect of our lives such as computing, communications, and health care. Advances in photonic and electronic materials thus bring unquestionable societal benefits in catalyzing revolutionary changes and transforming the platform that technologies are built on. The two-day workshop brings together leading experts performing research in several classes of materials that are representative of advanced electronic and photonic materials. Scientists and researchers working in the areas of electronic and photonic materials develop synthetic methods, characterization techniques and computational methods for new materials discovery, with potential for delivering transformative scientific and societal impacts. Young researchers trained in the field of electronic and photonic materials are also vital for ensuring the nation's competitive advantage in areas critical to national security, economic growth, and sustainable societal development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description: This workshop brings together leading experts to discuss the current challenges and future opportunities in the broad field of electronic and photonic materials. The goal of the proposed workshop is threefold: (i) to better understand what the scientific community views as current frontiers and future opportunities for electronic and photonic materials research; (ii) to assess the readiness within the research community to address scientific questions of national and societal importance; and (iii) to identify gaps and new areas for research in electronic and photonic materials in the near-future. The specific scope of the workshop covers epitaxially grown materials (semiconductors, oxide, and hybrid materials), van der Waals materials, polymeric/flexible materials, and metamaterials. Effective material development requires integrated efforts in computation, synthesis, characterization, and prototypical device demonstration. Workshop participants include experts in all these areas. A report summarizing the workshop serves to inform fellow researchers, policy makers, and the general public. The material platforms under discussion hold substantial promise for advancing communications, information processing, health care, and clean energy technologies. Young researchers trained in these research areas are vital for continually driving economic growth, ensuring competitive advantages in national security, and providing solutions for sustainable societal development.</AbstractNarration>
