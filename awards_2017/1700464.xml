<AbstractNarration>The Graduate Student Combinatorics Conference (GSCC) will be held April 7-9, 2017 at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. This will be the 13th annual edition of the GSCC, which is traditionally organized by graduate students and has benefited greatly from NSF support in the past. The GSCC focuses on graduate student research presentations and will include keynote addresses by Sara Billey (University of Washington) and Jacques Verstraete (University of California, San Diego). The GSCC provides a unique and invaluable opportunity for graduate students in combinatorics to experience the benefits of taking part in a research conference. Giving their own presentations allows graduate students to develop their teaching and presentation skills, helping them further succeed as junior researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics is a field of mathematics with applications to many disciplines. It is a vibrant area for new, innovative research that can involve problems and techniques within algebra, geometry, topology, probability, computer science, and analysis. This conference will keep junior investigators aware of the advances that have been made in this lively and exciting field. The GSCC provides a great opportunity for graduate students to network by meeting other young mathematicians with similar research topics that can lead to potential joint research projects and opportunities for future collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;Website: http://www.math.ku.edu/conferences/2017/GSCC/</AbstractNarration>
