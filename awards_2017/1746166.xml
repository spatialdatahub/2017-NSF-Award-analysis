<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase 1 project aims to develop a novel continuous rotational spiral solidification technology platform called Heliolithography (HL) to enable economical mass production of functional end-use 3D printed parts. The potential outcome of this feasibility study would be improving speed and performance of the prototypes to demonstrate key advantages of the process. This highly beneficial platform aims to advance 3D printing technology into production of functional parts. Its success would contribute to widespread job creation in the U.S. Manufacturing sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heliolithography utilizes continuous rotation to overcome the inefficiencies of a serial layer to layer process typical of stereolithography machines (SLA) that must reset, re-position, re-supply material so the next layer can be made. The rotating method serves as a continuous method to cure material, removes the adhesion force issue that impedes many SLA processes from scaling up, and resupplies new material to be cured in one motion. If successful, this will serve as a significant leap forward in the field that will provide greater throughput for mass producing and mass customizing 3D prints while allowing for the use of a broader range of advanced materials with higher viscosities. The research project will also focus on the development of an advanced non-stick coating and a tiled, high power, high resolution light engine. A tethered liquid interface nano-coating will be evaluated by bond line release and wear rate/durability tests. The performance of the light engine will be validated through direct power output measurements and also through extended functional testing for dimensional accuracy, repeatability, and tensile &amp; impact strengths of the printed parts.</AbstractNarration>
