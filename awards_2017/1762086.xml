<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in an international conference which will take place in Chemnitz (Germany) on "Singularities, Toric Geometry and Differential Equations" from March 19 to March 23, 2018. The use of differential equations is an omnipresent tool in the mathematical investigation of physical, chemical and biological phenomena, and dominates engineering applications as well. The conference will bring together international experts in the areas of commutative algebra and  differential equations.  The award will provide financial support for a number of US based graduate students and postdocs to attend this conference, thereby infusing our current generation of developing researchers with the latest trends and methods of the area. Sufficiently senior graduate students will have the opportunity of showcasing their own research in a poster session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core of the meeting will be focused on D-modules, a mathematical area that traditionally sits between singularity theory and representation theory, but which also has intriguing ties with topology, algebraic geometry, and Hodge theory. The talks, given by international experts from around the world, will touch on hypergeometric differential equations, applications to string theory, irregularity sheaves and twistors.  Recent discoveries that will be reported on touch Stokes structures, toric geometry, Milnor fibers and topology of singularities.
