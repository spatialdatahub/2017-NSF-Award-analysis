<AbstractNarration>With funding from the National Science Foundation's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, this project at California State University, Los Angeles (Cal State LA) is designed to address the NSF strategic goals of transforming frontiers by preparing future engineers and computer scientists with new capabilities and expertise as well as diversifying the workforce. As a federally designated Title III institution, the university has an historic commitment and record of service in meeting the educational needs of culturally diverse communities in Los Angeles. With support from S-STEM, the university will develop the Culturally Adaptive Pathway to Success (CAPS) program, which will build an inclusive pathway to accelerate the graduation for academically talented, low-income students in one of 4 majors (Civil Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering). The financial disadvantage of many students at the College of Engineering, Computer Science, and Technology (ECST) is often connected with inadequate academic preparation through K-12 education and limited family guidance. Hence, many students, including those who are academically-talented, experience significant challenges in achieving their academic goals. CAPS will focus on progressively developing social and career competence in students via three integrated interventions: (1) Mentor+, relationally informed advising that encourages students to see their academic work in relation to their families and communities; (2) peer cohorts, providing social support structure for students and enhancing their sense of belongings in engineering and computer science classrooms and beyond; and (3) professional development with difference-education, giving students support in situations where they practice reconciling how to navigate a world where others may have a different cultural script. The collaborative research between the educational psychologist and engineering and computer science educators will lead to better understanding on (a) how these interventions affect the development of social belonging and engineering identity of CAPS scholars, and (b) the impact of Mentor+ on academic resilience and progress to degree. The findings will be used to enhance the CAPS program and establish a sustainable Scholars Support Program at the university that can be transferred to similar culturally diverse institutions to increase success for students who have socio-economic challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAPS will support 2 cohorts of 14 scholars from their sophomore to senior years. The three key interventions (Mentor+, peer cohort, and difference-education in professional practice) will address the social and academic needs of students, including those from underrepresented minority groups.  Using this holistic support structure, the goal of the project is to have at least 90% of scholars persist in the programs, 50% graduate within 5 years and an additional 40% graduate within 6 years in engineering or computer science majors. The program will implement these interventions through a variety of activities including Mentor+ advisement, field trips, professional seminars, a sophomore learning cluster, and participation by scholars in professional conferences. By leveraging the existing college student services and initiatives, CAPS will extend the college capacity to support academically talented, low-income students and accelerate their graduation. Strong administrative support will ensure the smooth operation of the program. The CAPS program will also pilot a system to develop culturally responsive advisors and create a culture of culturally adaptive advising.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
