<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the high sample testing throughput necessary for quantum magnetic bioassay technology to be used for medical diagnostics, precision health and point of care patient care. Ultrasensitive detection of low-concentration biomarkers, many of which are currently undetectable by existing technology, offers new diagnostic capability for improved clinical decisions and better patient health. Existing high-sensitivity diagnostic instruments are very complex to use, expensive and require lengthy sample processing steps - all of which increase health care costs. A new class of magnetic-based assays combining high sensitivity and low sample processing using NV diamond quantum sensors has been developed. Magnetic assay platforms can deliver equivalent results to current biomarker assays faster and at significantly lower cost. A dramatic reduction in sample processing, combined with direct detection of magnetic tags, will provide rapid test results, a critical component for point of care diagnostics. A remaining challenge for this approach is delivering bioassay samples to the sensor quickly and repeatedly - a challenge to be addressed in this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a rapid sample transfer mechanism to enhance the sample throughput of bioassays using a quantum magnetic sensor. Quantum sensing enables revolutionary magnetic sensitivity and spatial resolution in a modality compatible with biological samples. However, the sample must be delivered close to the diamond sensor for analysis, and transfer between samples must occur in seconds, all while maintaining sensing performance. Prototype sample transfer systems designed and fabricated in this project will implement an innovative new process to rapidly transition between assay samples. The hardware will be compact, require little power, and be manufacturable at low cost. Prototype sample transfer hardware developed in Phase I will form the basis for subsequent engineering of quantum sensor based bioassay devices, with initial applications to the research use only (RUO) sector, and later to clinical in vitro diagnostics. This advance will bridge the gap between the capabilities of quantum magnetic sensing and the sample throughput needs of clinical applications.</AbstractNarration>
