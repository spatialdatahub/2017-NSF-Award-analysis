<AbstractNarration>High performance computing holds an enormous promise for revolutionizing science, technology, and everyday life through modeling and simulation, statistical inference, and artificial intelligence.  Despite the numerous successes in software and hardware technologies, energy efficiency barriers have become a major hurdle towards more powerful computers -- from mobile devices all the way to supercomputers. The originally natural separation between the memory subsystem and the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer has emerged as one the main reasons for energy inefficiency. Data movement between the memory and the CPU requires orders of magnitude more energy than the computations themselves. To address these challenges, this project will consider novel architectural design paradigms and algorithms that are aimed at blurring these traditional boundaries between separated memory and computation subsystems and, by distributing computations to be performed directly in the memory or as part of the memory data transfers, achieve order of magnitude gains inenergy efficiency and performance. This project will investigate such novel approaches in the context of a class of methods in computational mathematics, which appear at the core of many problems in computational science, large-scale data analytics, and machine learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project will focus on data-driven rather than compute-driven co-design of algorithms and architectures for the construction, approximation, and factorization of hierarchical matrices. The end-goal of the project is the design of a novel architecture, CISIT (for ``Computing In Situ and In Transit''), that specifically aims to address acceleration of both computation and data movement in the context of hierarchical matrices. CISIT will uniquely combine traditional general-purpose CPU and GPU cores with: (1) acceleration of core algorithmic primitives using custom hardware; (2) in-situ computing capabilities that will comprise both processing in or near main memory as well as computing within on-chip caches and memory close to the cores; (3) novel in-transit compute capabilities that will enable cutting down on and in many cases completely eliminating unnecessary roundtrip data transfers by processing of data transparently as it is transferred between main memory and local compute cores across the cache hierarchies. Upon success, CISIT will influence future architectural implementations.  Along with the research activities, an educational and dissemination program will be designed to communicate the results of this work to both students and researchers, as well as a more general audience of computational and application scientists.</AbstractNarration>
