<AbstractNarration>The project will demonstrate the potential of the bioprivileged molecule concept to systematically generate novel chemical compounds with improved performance properties.  There are two key aspects of the project: 1) the identification of new bioprivileged molecules, and 2) the diversification of existing bioprivileged molecules.  In the former, identifying new bioprivileged molecules, which requires the integration of biology and chemistry, is important for validating and expanding their role in developing biobased chemicals.  The diversification will involve synthesis of novel chemicals for inhibiting the corrosion of metals.  The novel chemicals, derived from biological sources with further refinement by chemical processes, have the potential to replace existing chemicals that are non-biological in origin, and some of which have adverse environmental and toxicity properties.  The project will be carried out in collaboration with researchers from Tuskegee University, a minority serving institution.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the project will investigate the chemical synthesis process that starts with triacetic acid lactone (TAL), - a bioprivileged molecule identified through the NSF-Engineering Center for Biorenewable Chemicals (CBiRC) - and builds on a previously identified synthesis pathway by the CBiRC team that converts TAL to opuntiol, a plant product having natural corrosion inhibition properties.  The crux of the project will involve the synthesis of several novel opuntiol analogs that are expected to demonstrate improved corrosion inhibiting properties compared to opuntiol.  The synthesis-related research will be conducted by a Tuskegee graduate student and his faculty advisor, and the corrosion inhibiting properties of the synthesized analogs will be assessed by the CBiRC team.  The project will also include a visit by the CBiRC leadership to the Materials Discovery Center at the University of Liverpool.  The Center is a collaborative enterprise between the University and industrial partners with state-of-the-art laboratories for high throughput screening of lab-scale samples of novel molecules for a broad range of potential industrial applications.  The visit will aid the CBiRC team in identifying methods and resources needed to link novel molecules to new product applications.</AbstractNarration>
