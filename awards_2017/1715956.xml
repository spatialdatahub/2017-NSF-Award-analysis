<AbstractNarration>All plants and animals exist in close partnership with communities of microbes, a relationship that is typically highly beneficial but can, in certain circumstances, lead to disease. Microbial communities provide to their hosts nutrients as well as small organic molecules that can function as molecular signals. These molecules generated by microbes are important to the normal development and physiological function of the host animal. One class of such nutrients (and signals) produced by microbes is the short-chain fatty acids, of which acetate is a familiar example. This project involves collaboration between laboratories at Amherst College (Purdy group) and Northern Michigan University (Sharp group) focused on understanding the signaling mechanisms in two bacteria (Vibrio and Pseudomonas) that regulate the levels of acetate and thereby its function in mediating interactions with microbial communities and animal hosts. This project will provide authentic research experiences for undergraduate students (including minorities under-represented in science) in both a course-based setting as well as in the investigators' laboratories. Women and under-represented minority students will be recruited and supported by peer-mentoring networks, and by outreach through public engagement including elementary and middle-school students, and groups such as Girl Scouts; Girls, Inc.; the Black Student Union High School Program, and the Marquette Children's Museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will establish how the signaling pathway initiated by CrbS in Vibrio and Pseudomonas senses and transmits information to The project will establish how the signaling pathway initiated by CrbS in Vibrio and Pseudomonas senses and transmits information to regulate acetyl CoA synthetase and thereby control the levels of short chain fatty acids. The role of the CrbS-dependent regulon will be investigated to understand its evolution and role in carbon metabolism and in other diverse cellular functions in bacteria.</AbstractNarration>
