<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This Purdue University/Technion collaborative project is exploring the fundamental science behind the formation of interfacial phases between ceramic electrolytes and cathode materials for all solid-state rechargeable Li-ion battery technology. Of great importance to this project is the development of a basic science understanding of the effect of processing parameters on ceramic materials with low interfacial resistance, stable mechanical contacts, and low bulk and interfacial porosity. This knowledge will help battery researchers find better ways to fabricate safe high performance cells. Modeling, simulation, advanced processing science, and characterization techniques are integrated to identify material and interface combinations that are the best in terms of being commercially accessible, high performing and reliable. This work provides the basic science foundation to design the next generation solid-state batteries and enables the rational integration of ceramic materials of complementary multifunctional properties for applications that go well beyond energy storage devices of higher energy densities and longer lifespans, such as those observed in fuel cells, super capacitors, reprogrammable sensors and electronics. Graduate student researchers involved in this project are gaining valuable experience by spending their summers learning and performing experiments on electrochemistry and battery materials at Technion. The concepts and tools developed herein are disseminated via nanoHUB, peer-reviewed journals such as the Journal of the American Ceramic Society, and undergraduate courses and research activities held at both institutions. The battery science and engineering gained by students provides an ideal stepping-stone for the development advanced energy storage materials and devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: The processing conditions that control the formation of structurally stable 2D interfacial phases that maximize the conductivity, ionic diffusivity, and phase stability of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are being explored. The goal is to gain a fundamental understanding on the formation of disordered, ionically conductive, but electronically insulating charged complexions at the interface between cathode and solid-state electrolyte phases. In particular, a Li3PO4 model electrolyte and a series of model LIB cathode materials: LiCoO2, LiFePO4, and LiMn2O4 are being studied. This represents a significant advance in the area of design of the next generation of all solid state batteries, where: modeling and simulation are used to predict the formation and conditions of stability of favorable heterostructural interfacial complexions; sintering experiments are combined with high-resolution electron microscopy to create and characterize 2D and 3D layered systems; and electrochemical characterization is used to extract the interfacial components of the impedance spectra and differentiate the different bulk and interfacial contributions for each of the processed configurations. The findings of this project extend to solid oxide fuel cells, high temperature ceramic gas sensors, and polycrystalline thermoelectrics.</AbstractNarration>
