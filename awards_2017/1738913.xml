<AbstractNarration>This project contributes to the joint initiative launched by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.K. Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) to substantially improve decadal and longer-term projections of ice loss and sea-level rise originating from Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica. The Science Coordination Office will facilitate planning and coordination of the science and broader impacts of several international research projects studying Thwaites Glacier--one of the largest glaciers in Antarctica. The glacier is located on the Pacific coast of the Antarctic continent. It is flowing almost twice as fast now as in the 1970s, and is one of the largest likely contributors to sea-level rise over the coming decades to centuries. Many of the factors that will affect the speed and retreat of Thwaites Glacier will be addressed by the set of projects funded by the Thwaites initiative. The Science Coordination Office comprises a US-UK science and communications team that will work with each project's scientists and students, logistics planners, and NSF and NERC to ensure the overall success of the project. The Office will maintain an informative website, and will produce content to explain the activities of the scientists and highlight the results of the work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The role of the Science Coordination Office will be to enhance integration and coordination among the science projects selected for the joint NSF-NERC Thwaites initiative to achieve maximum collective scientific and societal impact.  The Office will facilitate scientific and logistical planning; facilitate data management, sharing, and discovery; and facilitate and support web content, outreach, and education for this high-profile research endeavor. The Office's role will be key to enabling the program to achieve its scientific goals and for the program to be broadly recognized and valued by scientists, the public, and policymakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
