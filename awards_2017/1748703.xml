<AbstractNarration>The proposed project on US-EU Two-Dimensional (2D) Layered Materials and Devices Workshop seeks financial support to support researcher participation in a workshop to be held October 23-25, 2017 in Arlington, VA. The Workshop will address research areas of a wide range of non-graphene 2D atomic layers such as phosphorene, transition metal di-chalcogenides, hexagonal boron nitride, tertiary compounds of carbo-nitrides, and complex oxides. Techniques of scalable synthesis of these materials on multiple substrates and control of layer number and defect density will be addressed. The Workshop will bring together leading scientists working on graphene and beyond graphene 2D materials and devices from Europe and the United States to help promote future collaborations and address common challenges. It will also bring together program managers and administrators from the two regions to discuss mechanisms that can be put in place to facilitate future joint research programs. The workshop should positively impact learning in the science and engineering disciplines through personnel exchange programs that are likely to catalyze from this workshop, including bi-lateral exchange of faculty, graduate students and post-doctoral fellows. This workshop will have significant broader impact by catalyzing potential international partnerships between leading researchers in the US and Europe to discuss broad directions for future research in this highly dynamic and interdisciplinary area. It is expected that it will promote bi-lateral exchange of faculty, graduate students and post-doctoral fellows. Through such exchange, the workshop will also facilitate the training of a globally engaged workforce which should help promote science and engineering breakthroughs in present-day global economy. A final report detailing the discussion topics and conclusions/recommendations will also be posted.</AbstractNarration>
