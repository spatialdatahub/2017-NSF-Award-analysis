<AbstractNarration>This award funds the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in Physics at the University of Chicago.  The site will support twelve students for ten weeks of summer research at the University of Chicago each year.  The core of the program for each student is a well-defined 10- week summer research project under supervision of a University of Chicago faculty member.  The program provides students with exposure to the breadth and unity of physics, and the students will learn to communicate science by submitting a written report and making an oral presentation on their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The undergraduate students are introduced to many of the ideas of leading-edge research, and student projects are among: high-energy physics, cosmic-ray physics, astrophysics, general relativity, condensed-matter physics, non-linear dynamics, biophysics, and topological physics. A series of talks presented by faculty provides an overview of some of the most important research topics currently pursued in these areas of physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
