<AbstractNarration>This award was provided as part of NSF's Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (SPRF) program. The goal of the SPRF program is to prepare promising, early career doctoral-level scientists for scientific careers in academia, industry or private sector, and government. SPRF awards involve two years of training under the sponsorship of established scientists and encourage Postdoctoral Fellows to perform independent research. NSF seeks to promote the participation of scientists from all segments of the scientific community, including those from underrepresented groups, in its research programs and activities; the postdoctoral period is considered to be an important level of professional development in attaining this goal. Each Postdoctoral Fellow must address important scientific questions that advance their respective disciplinary fields. This postdoctoral fellowship award supports the training and research of a young scientist studying the interpersonal consequences of childhood exposure to family aggression in different relationship contexts. The project also incorporates methodological diversity, relying on longitudinal self-report data, coded observations, and daily diary data, which allow for examining critical micro- and macro-level interpersonal processes. Although past research shows that victims of parental aggression are at increased risk for experiencing victimization and/or exhibiting aggression in the context of their peer and romantic relationships, it remains unclear how and why exposure to family violence increases risk for future victimization and aggression. In order to interrupt these maladaptive cycles of violence, it is important to identify the underlying mechanisms that account for the stability of victimization over time and learn about potential protective factors that can buffer victims from enduring interpersonal difficulties. The current project seeks to delineate the interpersonal characteristics of youth with a history of victimization by directly examining adolescents' observed social behaviors in discussions with a close friend. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific aims of the current project are to examine a) how a history of family victimization influences adolescents? interpersonal style (e.g., affect, behavior) within a dyadic, friendship interaction and b) whether observed maladaptive interpersonal functioning with friends can account for the continuity of victimization over time (e.g., from family to dating partners). By studying victimization longitudinally, across different relational contexts (e.g., family, peer, and romantic partner), and using a range of methods (e.g., self-report, observational coding, daily diary), the proposed study has the potential to advance both methodological and theoretical approaches to studying antecedents and consequences of interpersonal violence. In addition to examining maladaptive interpersonal functioning as a key mechanism implicated in the continuity of victimization across different contexts, the project will investigate the buffering role of social support for adolescents with a history of victimization, relying on both lab-based observed interactions with a friend and daily diary reports. By considering interpersonal relationships as involving dynamic processes-unfolding through both moment-to-moment interactions and gradually over time?the project will offer unique insight into how peers can serve as both a source of stress and resilience across childhood and adolescence. Additionally, identifying the specific factors that maintain versus interrupt victimization stability is hoped to offer increased understanding of how to develop targeted intervention and prevention strategies among youth at risk for or experiencing interpersonal aggression.</AbstractNarration>
