<AbstractNarration>Networks are important subjects of study in several fields, including biology, social sciences, and security. Two important properties of networks that are often overlooked are that they are dynamic (change over time), and have features that are relevant at different scales. Thus, it is important to study networks from a dynamic and multiscale point of view. A natural model is to assume that we have not just one network, but a family of networks, indexed by one parameter (or may be more). That parameter can track changes as time passes, or as one change one's focus to different scales. In this project the PIs will develop analysis tools and techniques that provide useful insights, but are also efficiently computable for large networks, even when dealing with many values for the parameter. They concentrate on several measures of interest in the network analysis literature, like measures of centrality, hubs and authorities, good broadcasters and good receivers. The study of these measures becomes more difficult for larger networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Methods for discovering important features of a network are often based on matrix functions. Two of them are the matrix exponential and the resolvent; these can be heuristically justified as measuring connectivity between nodes by weighted sums of paths connecting them, and modifications of these functions can be easily devised to stress some features of the network over others. The PIs have developed methods for approximate computation and error estimation that can be applied to a wide class matrix functions. They will adapt and develop methods of approximate computation, and determine error estimates for these methods, as relevant to the project setting. Some quantifications of network features involve matrix decompositions, like the eigenvalue or singular value decompositions, while others involve only simple matrix summaries, like the diagonal entries, or row and column sums. The PIs will devise approaches for carrying out decompositions that take advantage of the closeness between the matrices when the parameters are close, in order to reduce the computational burden and to better keep track of the parts of the decomposition that rise or fall in importance as the parameter changes.</AbstractNarration>
