<AbstractNarration>The Framework for Transformative Geoscience Education Research project is a one-year effort to engage the geoscience education research community in setting ambitious goals for geoscience education research that will be achievable within ten years and will have significant impact on geoscience education teaching and learning. The objectives of the proposed project are: (1) to identify themes that span multiple geoscience education research (GER) topical areas to define the spectrum in which GER operates and has the potential to impact; (2) to articulate and prioritize "grand challenges" in GER for each of the themes that are of high interest to the geoscience education researcher and practitioner community; and (3) to develop strategies to address the prioritized grand challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities of the proposed project include: (a) a survey of the GER community to determine what members see as important research questions to address in GER in the next 10 years; (b) a workshop and oral session at the 2017 Earth Educators' Rendezvous (EER) for researchers to discuss and prioritize the grand challenges that emerge from the survey and to propose strategies to address the grand challenges; (c) continued online GER Toolbox development to support researchers as they address grand challenges in GER; (d) a GSA town hall and a second survey to share the workshop-proposed GER priorities and strategies with the broader community for their review and comment; and (e) a white paper about the synthesized findings of the project to share broadly the community's proposed research agenda for GER.</AbstractNarration>
