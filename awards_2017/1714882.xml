<AbstractNarration>Non-technical: This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Rutgers University is to design novel biomaterial 'inks' for 3D printing applications. The proposed research is aiming to address key challenges associated with current limitations in 3D printable biodegradable materials. 3D printing could help in the preparation of patient-specific devices with high structural complexity and design flexibility. At present, there is a lack of diversity in 3D printable materials for different applications, and hence limiting the widespread use, particularly in biomedical applications. This project will focus on developing novel 3D printable biodegradable polymer 'inks' for fused deposition, modeling and solvent-based printing. This study will provide polymer 'inks' with tunable mechanical properties, degradation, bioactivity and biocompatibility to develop materials for possible tissue engineering applications and regenerative medicine. This project covers a multi-disciplinary research area, providing opportunities in training of students at all levels. In addition, projects tailored for undergraduate students will be developed providing them with hands-on laboratory experience with this study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: The overall objective of this proposal is to create a library of new polymers with tunable functionality such as degradation and mechanical properties that could be used in the preparation of 3D scaffolds and devices. The proposal is composed of four major parts: (i) design and synthesis of novel polymer libraries based on tyrosine-derived polycarbonates and tyrosol-derived polyesters; (ii) characterize the properties and printability of the new polymers; (iii) demonstrate tunable polymer properties such as degradation, and mechanics that are controlled independently of each other; and (iv) evaluate application of these biomaterials for 3D printing. The proposed study will address major materials science challenges, and is expected to result in a new class of printable polymers for biomedical applications. The development of libraries of 3D printable, biodegradable polymers with tunable functionality such as degradation and mechanics will extend the use of 3D printing as a method for the preparation of bioactive materials for tissue engineering.</AbstractNarration>
