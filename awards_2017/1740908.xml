<AbstractNarration>This award will support participation of students and postdoctoral researchers in the conference "From Computational Biophysics to Systems Biology 2017" (CBSB2017) to be held at the University of Cincinnati on May 18-20, 2017. Systems biology seeks to understand complex biological processes by looking into the machinery of cells. Because cellular processes are often controlled by interactions which are formed and broken on a micro- or millisecond time scale, computational biophysics tools can complement systems biology experiments by tracing these transient interactions. The conference will bring together researchers from multiple disciplines by providing a platform for exchanging information on current trends in computational biophysics and systems biology, for establishing collaborations, and for obtaining a detailed understanding of cells at a molecular level. The conference will include a diverse group of invited speakers and strongly encourages participation of female and underrepresented minority students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CBSB2017 will include in-depth discussion of cutting-edge research results obtained by international scientists at all levels in their careers. The meeting will include 100-120 participants. Fifteen keynote and invited speakers will discuss recent algorithmic developments and present successful applications of high-performance computing in biological science. Students and postdoctoral researchers submitting the best five abstracts will be selected for young investigator awards and will be invited to give oral presentations. In addition, ten contributed talks and the poster session will provide early-career participants the opportunity to discuss their ongoing research in the context of the conference. By educating a diverse group of early-career participants, including female and underrepresented minority researchers, and by providing a forum for young scientists to present their research into the molecular workings of cells, the workshop will assist in training the next generation of computational scientists to solve fundamental problems in biophysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology, Molecular Biophysics and Cellular Dynamics and Function Programs in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.</AbstractNarration>
