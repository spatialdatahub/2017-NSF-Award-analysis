<AbstractNarration>This award supports a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Physics at the University of Texas at Dallas. The site supports between six and eight students per year for ten weeks of research in projects in experimental or theoretical physics.  Student participants will develop research, problem solving and communication skills by immersion in cutting-edge research in physics and through a series of workshops and seminars. As well as developing independence in research, working in the framework of a mentor's research group along with graduate students, participants will build teamwork skills. Special workshops will increase awareness of graduate school, academic and non-academic career options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will be able to choose from research topics including biophysics, computational physics, condensed matter physics, cosmology and gravity. The key objectives of the program are to instill in the participants the excitement of research and careers in science, and to build their research skills both independently and in research teams.  The development of core, transferable research skills such as data analysis, computer programming and statistics will underpin each of the research projects and will be the focus of student workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
