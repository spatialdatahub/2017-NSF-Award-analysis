<AbstractNarration>The field of gravitational wave astronomy has just experienced a major transformation as a result of a recent breakthrough - the first ever discovery of gravitational waves from a black hole binary system by the US LIGO detectors in Louisiana and Washington. These waves were predicted by Einstein himself a century ago, and had never been directly observed before. Upcoming observations of these waves from similar binary systems will be used to obtain additional information about exotic astrophysical objects in the Universe like black holes, neutron stars, and others. LIGO has also generated significant spin-off technologies, and drawn public and youth attention towards STEM disciplines. This research project aids in the development of the theory-based science that plays a very critical role in LIGO's mission. The main objective is to understand important aspects of black hole systems using theoretical and computational techniques. The project includes support for students and therefore directly contributes to student mentorship, traineeship and retention in an important STEM area. The computational skills that students develop are highly "portable", and therefore will allow them access to a variety of career options, including in areas of great national need. Previous research projects by the PI have been discussed in the general media, and  this work also has great potential at being successful for outreach to the general public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will contribute to a number of challenging and important problems in the area of gravitational physics. The main objective is the development and application of a time-domain computational model for the gravitational wave emission from a large mass-ratio black hole binary system using point-particle perturbation theory. Significant contributions will be made to the development of effective-one-body and other models for gravitational waveform generation, that will positively impact the data analysis of current and future detectors (such as LIGO and future space-borne missions). In addition, the planned work will bring about a much better understanding of the plunge phase radiation and quasi-normal ringing in the context of decaying black hole binary systems. The project will also contribute to the gravitational wave data-analysis effort via the open and public Einstein@Home project. All the research activities in the context of this project will involve students and collaborations with other US and international groups.</AbstractNarration>
