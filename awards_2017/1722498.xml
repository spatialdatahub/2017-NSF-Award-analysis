<AbstractNarration>Title: Travel Support for an International Conference on Identifying Pathways for Deployment of Carbon Capture and Utilization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1722498 Wilcox&lt;br/&gt;Carbon capture, storage, and utilization is a pressing topic in light of climate change concerns and the Paris 2016 International Treaty.  Current routes for industrial-scale carbon capture significantly increase energy costs while decreasing overall efficiency of energy conversion.  This project provides funds for two students and two speakers to attend an international conference in Italy to discuss carbon capture, storage, and utilization technologies in light of this international engineering challenge, with considerable social, economic, and political barriers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organizing committee for the conference strove to provide a unique venue for discussions of economics and engineering issues of carbon capture and utilization.  High-profile speakers will provide plenaries, while younger researchers will present more technical information. Outcomes from the conference will be published as a special issue in "Frontiers Energy Research" journal. The conference is modeled after a Gordon Research conference, and will be kept relatively small to facilitate in depth discussions and spur collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
