<AbstractNarration>This project provides travel support for US scientists to participate in the 38th International Congress of Physiological Sciences in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, August 1-5, 2017.  The meeting is organized by the International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS) and the travel awards will be administered by the American Physiological Society (APS).  The meeting assembles approximately 3,000 of the top comparative animal physiologists in the world, including many established scientists from the United States. The travel awards will be given to qualified scientists interested in comparative organismal physiology, and special emphasis will be given to early career investigators (within 15 years of receiving their doctoral degree) and to women and under-represented minority scientists. The project therefore broadens the participation of young scientists with an emphasis on women and under-represented minorities; exposes new investigators and students to cutting edge research designed to understand physiological processes and traits; and provides unique opportunities for the development of international collaborations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS) will hold the 38th International Congress of Physiological Sciences in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, August 1-5, 2017. The American Physiological Society (APS) has administered a travel grant program to assist U.S. scientists engaged in physiological research and its applications to attend Congresses every four years since the IUPS Congress was held in Buenos Aires in 1959. Special emphasis will be given to investigators within 15 years of receiving their doctoral degree and to women and under-represented minority scientists. Travel awards resulting from this proposal will be directed to individuals working in the research areas supported by the NSF Division of Integrative Organismal Systems. An internal program committee developed the scientific program for the 38th Congress with representatives from the host society, Brazilian Society of Physiology, and the IUPS. The program is organized around a number of IUPS Commissions. Traditionally, the one most relevant to NSF is associated with the Commission Comparative Physiology: Evolution, Adaptation &amp; Environment. The specific aims of this proposal include:  1) to promote widespread participation of young scientists with an emphasis on women and under-represented minorities, through a travel award program; 2) to engage new investigators and students in pursuing research designed to understand physiological processes and traits; and, 3) to provide opportunities for the development of collaborative interactions with scientists from the United States and those working outside of the United States.</AbstractNarration>
