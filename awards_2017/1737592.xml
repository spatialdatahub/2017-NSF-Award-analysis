<AbstractNarration>"Smart technologies" have been developed in urban areas; however, those products do not easily adapt to help rural communities that lack much of the infrastructure and "connectivity" of more densely populated cities. This planning grant seeks to assess and develop technology and targeted training to advance a small rural population in Eastern Texas.  The program will integrate engineering, computer science and social science expertise to engage community stakeholders. The leadership will work with the city government to improve the quality of life through advancing the use of smart technology.  Surveys and focus groups will be used to identify technology priorities of the region. This adaptive structure and plan could be used as a model for other rural communities to engage in similar programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lack of communication, low income, an aging population and infrastructure are just some of the challenges facing the rural community that is the target of this planning grant. This project seeks to engage the community in order to complete an extensive needs and capability assessment that can be used to inform smart technology researchers as to the best way to implement smart technologies. Approach:  Focus groups and surveys will be used in order to collect qualitative and quantitative data. Technology researchers will work alongside educational and social behavioral specialists to integrate an appropriate educational plan into the implementation timeline. Intellectual Merit: This project seeks to enable smart technologies to address concerns that are specific to rural communities. The largest potential benefit from this proposal will come from enhancing rural residents' quality of life though the exploration of smart technology. In addition, government and other stakeholders will learn about how to use smart technologies to manage a rural town with aged infrastructure and limited capacity efficiently. Broader Impacts:  This project will engage students and faculty in the research and development areas and provide training to students and community members. This project provides a unique opportunity to train two student researchers.</AbstractNarration>
