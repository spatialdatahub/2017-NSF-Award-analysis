<AbstractNarration>This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, will provide undergraduate students from resource limited institutions, as well as women and minorities, research opportunities in nanoscience and nanotechnology. This program will be carried out at the University of Iowa, run for 10 weeks during the summer session, and be administered through the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Institute at the University of Iowa (NNI@UI). Participants will be recruited from institutions with limited undergraduate research opportunities, and underrepresented minorities and women will be recruited by coordinating with on-going diversity efforts at the University of Iowa. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REU participants will be provided with a stimulating research experience focused on (1) giving students the opportunity to work on a cutting-edge research project focused on nanoscience and nanotechnology under faculty mentorship, (2) helping undergraduate students develop strong research and communications skills through seminars on laboratory safety and scientific ethics, a technical communication workshop, and participation in a university-wide summer undergraduate research symposium, (3) training undergraduate students in the interdisciplinary area of nanoscience and nanotechnology, a field of demonstrated scientific importance, (4) encouraging student participation from institutions with limited research opportunities and from underrepresented groups (including women in engineering) through vigorous recruiting efforts, and (5) encouraging REU participants to pursue graduate studies by informing them of opportunities for graduate study and application procedures. Faculty mentors from Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Chemistry, and Pharmacy will guide these students in their research. Given the importance of nanoscience and nanotechnology, it is imperative to provide undergraduates with early exposure to research in this interdisciplinary field and to enhance their interest in science and engineering for graduate studies and as a career path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this REU Site is provided by the National Science Foundation, Directorate for Engineering, Division of Engineering Education and Centers and the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Science, Division of Chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
