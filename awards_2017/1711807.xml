<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2017. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The host institution for the fellowship is the University of California, Riverside and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Daniel Koenig.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Barley is the world's fourth most important grain crop, and is unusually robust to a diversity of environmental stresses earning the moniker, the crop at the edge of the desert. Understanding the genetic basis of crop performance in variable environments is imperative, but long-term studies translating genotype to phenotype are exceedingly rare. To fill this gap, the genetic basis of local adaptation will be explored in a near century long agricultural experiment, the barley composite cross II (CCII). The CCII was initiated in the 1920's and has been allowed to adapt to the local conditions in Davis, CA for over 50 generations. With this unique resource, cutting edge high-throughput phenotype and genotype characterization methods will be employed to elucidate the genetic basis of agricultural performance.  The ultimate goal of this study is to predict successful genotypes in variable environmental conditions. Thriving during climatic extremes will minimize potential food insecurity arising from environmental factors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project will focus on the characterization of 1000 individuals drawn from four time points in the CCII experiment to elucidate the effect of local selective pressures on phenotype and genotype. Phenotypic data will be collected at three resolutions: single time point measurements of whole plant and inflorescence traits, temporal growth rate measurements using webcam monitoring, and inflorescence 3D renderings using CT scanning. Using a combination of genome-wide SNP discovery and ascertainment strategies, adaptive shifts in phenotype will be linked to specific genetic changes. The results of this project will be shared with the general public through multiple outreach programs, increasing the understanding of how crops adapt to changing environments.</AbstractNarration>
