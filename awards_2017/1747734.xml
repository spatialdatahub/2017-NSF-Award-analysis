<AbstractNarration>This planning grant award will be used to study the feasibility of establishing a university-industry partnership in the area of healthcare-in-place. While the primary focus will be on aging patients, pediatric chronic conditions are endemic in American society yet largely unrecognized by healthcare providers. The proposed Center to Stream Healthcare In Place (C2SHIP) would unite the best minds in academic medicine with leaders in the biomedical industry to research and develop intelligent monitoring and intervening wearable technologies, and in particular will be focused on enabling and promoting aging in place, personalized medicine, and smart management of chronic and non-communicable disease through telecommunication, data mining, and comprehensive feedback. The thrust of our research will be on the aging patient's central role and responsibility in enabling an optimized healthcare ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our trans-disciplinary research will pursue research and development in reconfigurable designs and system integration centered on the aging/health "in place" concept:  establishment of an environment or mobile hub for patient-in-need within his/her own location facilitated by the streaming of data to medical professionals at remote locations in real time through the Internet of Things. This represents a crucial first step toward characterizing abnormalities in environment and activity. Moreover, the proposed C2SHIP will focus on the mitigation of physiological, environmental, and psychological changes for real time management and intervention as well as infuse new in place technologies into relevant user communities and residences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed C2SHIP will investigate techniques and mechanisms that can facilitate real time interventions for a number of chronic diseases. The Center will not only advance the science of physiology, aging and pediatric medicine but also accelerate both knowledge and intellectual property transfer between academia and industry through our collaborative partnerships. This will allow for the rapid development of new in place technologies that can potentially transform health care delivery, reduce health care costs related to care of chronic disease and preventable re-admissions, and improve outcomes and quality of life for aging and chronically ill patients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data produced from this project will be deposited in servers at the C2SHIP Center under password protection and kept for five years, with sharing enabled through a commercial provider. No personal identifiers will be recorded or retained by the researchers in any form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
