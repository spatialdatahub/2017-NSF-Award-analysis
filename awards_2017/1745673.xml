<AbstractNarration>A wealth of information is being created at an increasingly fast rate from social media sources such as Twitter. Many researchers need text analytics on social media data to obtain domain-specific insights, by doing various computational tasks such as keyword search, regular expression, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis. A main challenge is their lack of IT background, making it hard for them to conduct research efficiently. In addition, very often they need to use machine learning models to do deep analysis, and the data-preparation process for generating labeled instances for training models can be time consuming and labor intensive. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies how to support text analytics on social media data by users who do not have a strong IT background. It develops an open-source system with the following goals: (1) modularizing common text computation as basic operators; (2) providing a graphic user interface (GUI) for users to form a workflow plan declaratively without writing code; (3) supporting text analytics as a Web-based service; and (4) supporting indexing whenever possible to improve performance. The system has been under development on Github for more than 15 months with more than 30 committers and 21 thousand lines of high-quality source code. An initial prototype is setup and used by Public Health researchers at UC Irvine to analyze Twitter data. The techniques are general-purpose, systems-oriented, and can benefit many other domains as well.</AbstractNarration>
