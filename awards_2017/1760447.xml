<AbstractNarration>During hurricanes, residents continue to refuse mandatory evacuation orders because of their pets. In other cases, evacuees leave animals behind. Both of these issues are a problem for emergency managers and households because both scenarios can lead to loss of life, considerable distress among pet owners, and logistic challenges for first responders and shelter coordinators. The PETS Act (2006) was designed to solve some of these problems, especially as they were highlighted after Hurricane Katrina. During Hurricane Matthew -- and more recently with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, however, the evacuation of people and their companion animals still presents on-going challenges. Communication about pet-friendly sheltering, the distance and resources required to travel to these locations, and time spent preparing for evacuation with animals all present significant evacuation barriers to residents. This project explores the strategies used by groups amidst Hurricanes Harvey and Irma that resulted in the successful and timely evacuation of companion animals and also explains the ways in which residents made decisions based on their animals. The benefit of this research is through the potential to enhance evacuations by identifying "best practices" for stakeholders managing pets. The researchers may also uncover issues related to social vulnerability, organizational coordination, quick response fieldwork strategies, and other aspects of the research that could be considered important for methodological advances in disaster research and the broader body of knowledge on disasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Companion animals are connected to human residents and families. When people refuse or delay evacuation because of their pets, this may lead to loss of life. Therefore, improving evacuation compliance levels associated with the management of pets is a matter of risk reduction. Situated in the broader work on evacuation, disaster policy, and protective action, the three main purposes of this project are to: 1) expand the definition of Focusing Events Theory through group mobilization after policy change in the context of the PETS Act 2) identify and measure the protective action aspects of pets and evacuation from an evacuee perspective, and 3) to use the theoretical model components to create tangible strategies for improved evacuation of companion animals and evacuees. The data from the project involve mixed-methods and are collected in areas heavily impacted by Harvey and Irma in Texas and Florida. Qualitative data ensure the richness of narratives connected to the evacuation decision making surrounding pets, while the quantitative data ensure that the research variables can be measured in multivariate statistical analyses. Results are disseminated to emergency managers and other groups working with understanding and managing and helping people and their companion animals in disasters.</AbstractNarration>
