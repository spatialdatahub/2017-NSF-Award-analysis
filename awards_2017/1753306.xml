<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;As electronic devices shrink in size, their overall performance is degrading. Novel materials based on quantum phenomena need to be explored in order to further boost the performance and reduce size of future electronic devices. One particular promising class of such quantum materials are topological insulators which are characterized by electrically non-conductive bulk alongside with a highly conductive electronic state at its boundaries. This program focuses on experimental research of the properties in two-dimensional (2D) topological insulators that are only a few atoms thick. The properties of these materials can be engineered by stacking monolayers with different material composition and controlled by applying electric fields. The research aspects of this project are accompanied by an extensive educational and outreach plan aimed to prepare graduate and undergraduate students for successful careers in industry and academia as well as help educate general public about quantum science and nanotechnology through lectures and lab tours for high-school students and teachers from the Pasadena Unified School District. Moreover, all results from this project will be broadly disseminated through the talks at national and international conferences and journal articles as well as in publicly accessible blog posts and educational videos targeting broad audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports experimental exploration of topological phases of matter in van der Waals materials and hetero-structures. Due to their intrinsic 2D character, these ultrathin materials can be studied by closely integrated combination of quantum transport measurements and scanning probe microscopy. The research team will focus on correlating local structural and electronic properties of the edge states obtained using scanning tunneling microscopy with the overall transport signatures in variety of experimental settings. This approach will allow for novel insights into the relevant backscattering mechanisms as well as into the spin polarization and spin relaxation of the helical edges. The team will also explore prospects of coupling 2D topological van der Waals materials to superconductors in order to create topologically protected superconducting quantum states in one and zero dimensions. This project will offer ample opportunities for integrating research, education and outreach. In particular, as a part of this project, the principle investigator will develop lectures for the general public and enhance course curriculum for undergraduate and graduate students that will cover the most recent topics in quantum science and nanotechnology. The research results will be broadly disseminated through the talks at national and international conferences and journal articles as well as in publicly accessible blog posts and educational videos targeting broad audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
