<AbstractNarration>A knot is a closed curve in three-dimensional space. More generally, a link is a collection of several such curves. Two links are equivalent if one can be transformed to another by a continuous deformation and/or stretching (without tearing). A link invariant is a quantity that does not change under the deformations of a link. Such invariants can be used to distinguish links and to study geometric properties of knots, and many powerful link invariants have been developed in recent decades. In another direction, the mathematical subject of algebraic geometry studies spaces described by polynomial equations and has applications in a wide range of fields, including statistics, control theory, and computer science. This project is focused on surprising interactions between the invariants of links and algebraic geometry that appear in two different mathematical frameworks. It is anticipated that the research will provide new perspectives on the relationships between low-dimensional topology, algebraic geometry, representation theory, and combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the first framework is classical: given a complex plane curve singularity, its intersection with a small sphere is a link. Similarly, for a complex surface singularity its link is a three-manifold. The investigator will the study the interactions between the algebraic properties of these curves and surfaces, and the Heegaard-Floer homology of their links. The second framework is less direct. The investigator and collaborators have conjectured that the Khovanov-Rozansky homology of links can be computed by studying the algebraic and geometric properties of the Hilbert scheme of points (the configuration space of points in four-dimensional space). The Hilbert scheme is well studied in algebraic geometry, representation theory and combinatorics, so this interpretation would yield explicit computations of Khovanov-Rozansky homology that were previously out of reach. In this project the investigator will develop the connection between knots and the Hilbert scheme, with the goals of computing these invariants for various classes of links and proving the conjecture.</AbstractNarration>
