<AbstractNarration>This project, from San Diego State University, creates an I-Corps Site at this institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. This is a Type II I-Corps Site involving the extension of funding for an existing I-Corps Site that was first funded in 2013. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Site extensions of the California State University (CSU) Program for Education and Research in Biotechnology (CSUPERB) for an additional three years builds on experience as an I-Corps Site and grows institutional support for life sciences entrepreneurship education and technology transfer. The activities involved in this renewal aim to smooth the development path for nascent academic entrepreneurs across the CSU. Specifically during Phase II, CSU I-Corps is: recruiting biological sciences researchers and funding 30 Site Teams annually, providing opportunities to discover biotechnology commercialization pathways; building on CSU I-Corps' growing community of life science entrepreneurs, alumni, industry experts and campus-based entrepreneurship resources to offer tailored advice for research-based ventures; and developing a three-part program for nascent biological sciences entrepreneurs to help them escape social and cognitive biases, explore venture ideas, assess technologies to solve problems, and discover commercialization pathways. The I-Corps Biological Sciences Site nurtures CSU researchers so that they gain confidence in their entrepreneurial abilities, greater understanding of biotechnology commercialization pathways, and a better calibration of their concepts maturity level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than a quarter of the CSU STEM baccalaureates are from underrepresented populations - CSU educates more Hispanic, African-American, and American Indian undergraduates than all other institutions in the state combined. The CSU diverse student population is engaged in immersive learning provided by biological sciences research and entrepreneurial activities. Employers and investors value creative students who graduate with demonstrated accomplishments in team-based research, the ability to solve real-world problems, and experience with the unique challenges of biotechnology commercialization. CSU I-Corps gives students and faculty access to mentors, sources of capital, business expertise, and leadership opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
