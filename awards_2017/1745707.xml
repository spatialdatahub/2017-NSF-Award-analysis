<AbstractNarration>In Materials Science and Engineering, "texture" refers to the arrangement of crystals at the microstructure scale within a wide range of materials, including metals, minerals and even various plastics. The study of texture has led to improved design of materials, the discovery of new superconducting materials, and the uncovering of many exciting insights into the geological history of the earth. The International Conference on Texture of Materials (ICOTOM) has provided a venue for international cross-pollination of scientific ideas in this field since 1968. This year?s conference, which returns to USA every nine years, will be held in St George, Utah. The conference celebrates 25 years since the invention of automated Electron Backscatter Diffraction - "EBSD" - originally funded by the National Science Foundation, and fundamental to accelerated scientific study in a myriad of sub-disciplines. Furthermore, it is held in a geologically significant region that will provide added meaning for many participants. This conference support award will allow broad student participation in the conference. This support will allow students from all backgrounds to attend this important scientific gathering. Students will be encouraged to present oral or poster presentations, and thus interact directly with top scientists in the field. This effort will help prepare and diversify the next generation of texture scientists for tackling some of society's most fundamental engineering issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Texture analysis lies at the heart of the study of crystalline materials. At the 2017 International Conference on Textures of Materials, sessions will address the growing diversity of topics, including texture of interfaces, deformation and transformation textures, microstructure characterization, and the relationships between microstructure and behavior of a wide range of geological and engineering materials. The conference provides a unique venue for the cross pollination of ideas across the two primary texture disciplines: geoscience and materials science. The exchange of cutting-edge knowledge from the two communities will facilitate research developments in both.</AbstractNarration>
