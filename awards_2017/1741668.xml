<AbstractNarration>Driven by the challenges as well as opportunities for high-impact research to advance the quality of life in small, remote, and rural communities, the University of Virginia will convene a workshop to explore challenges and research opportunities, to facilitate collaborations, and ultimately, to define a connected rural communities research agenda. Specifically, the research exploration will be discussed through the lens of how technology, communications, and networking can advance polycentric development. The two-day workshop will bring together researchers, practitioners, nonprofit organizations, industry partners, government representatives, and community stakeholders in the domain of Smart and Connected Communities (S&amp;CC) with representation from around the United States (U.S.).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful implementation of this workshop will result in a connected rural communities research agenda detailing new opportunities for research with long-term impact and near-term outcomes. Participants will engage in discussions to characterize and design future S&amp;CC testbeds together with communities themselves, to support the interative S&amp;CC research cycle necessary for transformative innovations that benefit communities. The workshop will explore a diversity of domains (e.g., mobility, economic development, education, and public and telehealth) and their interconnectivity. In order to assure representation of multiple perspectives, the workshop organizers will prioritize participation of minority and underrepresented community members, and those that can speak from experience on the relevant challenges and opportunities in small, remote, and rural communities around the U.S. It is anticipated that half of the participants will be from outside the academic community. Participation of early-career researchers and practitioners are especially emphasized to catalyze new partnerships and research communities in this critical domain.</AbstractNarration>
