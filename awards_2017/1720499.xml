<AbstractNarration>Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) is a mechanism that allows physical handling of liquids with only electrical signals, such as digitizing a liquid into tiny droplets and manipulating them on a chip, thus enabling "digital microfluidics." As an elegantly simple platform free of pumps or valves, EWOD digital microfluidics has been attracting high research interest in the past 15 years and has recently been transitioned to a few commercial products in displays and biochemistry. However, the number of labs utilizing the technology is still small, likely due to the difficulty in translating design intent to manufactured devices. The project will perform fundamental research to enable a cloud-based EWOD manufacturing system to perform that translation. The resulting cybermanufacturing ecosystem will be accessible to a wide range of users, allowing researchers, entrepreneurs, students, and hobbyists alike to focus on their own ideas and applications without having to master the subtleties of EWOD engineering and manufacturing. This may be thought of as an "operating system" for EWOD microfluidics, similar to the computer operating systems that enabled people with no computer hardware background to use personal computers. This cybermanufacturing system is envisioned to have a similar impact on the field of EWOD digital microfluidics. The project includes incorporation of research results in coursework, outreach to and involvement of undergraduate and high school students, and collaborations with an established chip foundry and a distinguished biochemist. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will incorporate knowledge from EWOD research in a framework of cloud-based design and manufacturing. If manufacturing is transparent, people of a wide range of disciplines and levels can take advantage of EWOD digital microfluidics. A design/manufacturability engine will allow users to express their specific intention in a step-by-step EWOD-compatible design protocol, which then will be converted to a verified manufacturable EWOD chip layout. When an order is placed, the design file will be sent to a chip fabrication foundry. The user may also order an EWOD control module and ancillary modules (e.g., programmed heating, magnetic beads), advised by the design system and community experience. A gateway will be made available through online graphical user interface that allows the user to operate multiple modules and systems remotely, greatly expanding the capability and promoting collaborations. The system architecture will ensure bottom-up, organic growth of users and providers as well as the knowledge in design, manufacturing, and application of EWOD digital microfluidics.</AbstractNarration>
