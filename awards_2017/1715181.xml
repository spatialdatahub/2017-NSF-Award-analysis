<AbstractNarration>In the past, galaxies in massive clusters often had extra sources of energy in their inner regions.  But the incidence of these so-called active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has declined over time.  This decline means that galaxies in crowded galaxy neighborhoods are evolving.  To help understand that evolution, the team will analyze observations of about 2000 distant clusters at radio, infrared and optical wavelengths.  Senior team members will train junior team members.  The team will also partner with Florida's Center for Precollegiate Education and Training.  Via that STEM partnership, the team will develop materials to train high-school students and teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will use observations to investigate the distribution, frequency, and properties of AGNs in massive clusters of galaxies at a redshift of about one.  The team's goals are (1) to quantify the spatial distribution of AGNs as a function of environment and redshift, to isolate the physical factors that trigger AGNs, (2) to determine the impact of a cluster's halo mass on the AGN associated with its central galaxy, and (3) to constrain the duty cycle and energetic feedback from the AGNs in the brightest cluster galaxies.</AbstractNarration>
