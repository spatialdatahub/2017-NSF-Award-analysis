<AbstractNarration>This award is to support student travel to the Fourteenth Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI 2017) will be held in Boston, MA on March 27-29, 2017.  The conference focuses on the design principles of large-scale networks and distributed systems and, in particular, challenges that are shared across systems as diverse as internet routing, peer-to-peer file sharing, sensor nets, scalable web services, and distributed network measurement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSDI 2017 will offer many opportunities for students to meet, interact, and exchange ideas in an informal atmosphere, including a welcome reception with members of the program committee, speakers, and organizers who are on site; small evening birds-of-a-feather sessions(including WiAC, the Women in Advanced Computing meetup), and more. USENIX also enlists the help of student volunteers to serve as scribes to summarize the talks and Q&amp;A at all conference sessions. These reports are published in an issue of ;login:, giving additional value to the students via a deeper understanding of the material, writing experience, and interactions with speakers and other students collaborating on these reports</AbstractNarration>
