<AbstractNarration>The Center for Undergraduate Research in Mathematics (CURM) promotes academic year undergraduate research in mathematics and statistics based upon a model consisting of (a) training faculty members to mentor students in research, (b) engaging 2-5 students and a faculty mentor in research during the academic year at their own institution, (c) preparing students to succeed in graduate studies, and (d) advising faculty members on how to maintain consistent undergraduate research including finding resources for other funding sources. Each year, CURM will administer mini-grants to about 54 undergraduate students working in 16 groups during the academic year at various institutions across the U.S, and will provide a workshop for faculty mentor training and spring conference events for students to present their research. In past years, CURM has primarily reached four-year or comprehensive institutions. The center is now expanding its reach by (a) creating regional cross-institutional collaborations, with an emphasis on community colleges; (b) promoting regional mathematical community by integrating CURM into regional mathematical structures and outreach activities; and (c) incubating research activity at teaching-focused institutions through connections to student research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CURM participants will perform research in various areas of mathematics. Undergraduate students will conduct research in mathematics, prepare and present conference talks, and write and publish research papers related to this research. Faculty will revitalize their research programs and connect their work to their local mathematical community. Engaging students in research provides these faculty members with an opportunity to align their research interests with the goals of their institutions. This can be particularly important for women and other underrepresented groups whose work is known to be undervalued and are who are therefore more likely to work at an institution whose research emphasis is not matched with their research talents. By adding institutional partnerships, CURM stands to spread its mentoring expertise to PhD-granting institutions where mentoring may not be a priority, and its connections to a well-established network for community colleges where undergraduate research in mathematics has not yet taken hold. The new effort to cultivate regional strengths through CURM stands to contribute to robust intellectual communities in more isolated parts of the country.</AbstractNarration>
