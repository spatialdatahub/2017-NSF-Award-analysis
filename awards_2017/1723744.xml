<AbstractNarration>This exploratory research project is studying socially-relevant Making in the context of an on campus&lt;br/&gt;university Makerspace. Project studies are developing best practice models of how&lt;br/&gt;informal STEM learning through Making can be leveraged to improve the effectiveness of both&lt;br/&gt;informal and formal learning approaches, as well as to increase retention and broaden&lt;br/&gt;participation in STEM education for students and faculty. This is being studied across both&lt;br/&gt;secondary and post-secondary levels in partnership with a local engineering-focused high school.&lt;br/&gt;Project research is grounded in a specific socially-relevant challenge problem: designing and&lt;br/&gt;fabricating prosthetic hands for children who need them. Challenge problem activities are&lt;br/&gt;connected directly to real world context and outcomes in partnership with a nonprofit&lt;br/&gt;organization that specializes in facilitating and providing 3D printed recreational prosthetic&lt;br/&gt;hands free of charge for children with limb differences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project research is defining novel integrations of informal and formal STEM learning pathways,&lt;br/&gt;providing case studies, learning materials, lessons learned, and scalable design templates for&lt;br/&gt;learning ecosystems at other institutions. The focus on design thinking supports learning&lt;br/&gt;benefits from cross-disciplinary interaction, particularly in interdisciplinary peer learning of&lt;br/&gt;STEM concepts, exposing non-STEM learners to STEM concepts, and disrupting traditional&lt;br/&gt;teacher-student roles. Project outcomes are catalyzing and sustaining diverse learner transitions&lt;br/&gt;to a Maker STEM-based affinity identity by identifying best practice design patterns for learning,&lt;br/&gt;focused by the challenge problem, which can be applied more generally to foster synergetic&lt;br/&gt;interactions between formal and informal learning within educational environments.</AbstractNarration>
