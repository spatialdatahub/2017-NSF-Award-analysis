<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation, in cooperation with the Large Scale Networks (LSN) Interagency Working Group, has hosted a series of technical workshops over the past 4 years focused on advancing our understanding of the use of Software Defined Networking (SDN) in operational networks. These workshops have convened the academic networking research community, network operators, telecom equipment vendors, and government technologists and regulators in order to share their experience in deploying SDN-capable equipment in various settings.  This proposal seeks participant travel and meeting logistics support for a 2 1/2-day workshop to be held in Washington, DC, on September 18-20, 2017. Approximately 80 participants will represent stakeholders including academia, industry, open-source communities, and government agencies. The workshop will build on the discussions held at the previous two workshops, and facilitate a dialogue to identify research opportunities and achievable milestones for the community to advance the state of operational SDN networks. SDN is critical technology for US IT to retain a competitive advantage in telecommunications and cloud computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop provides a timely intellectual exchange among researchers, developers, and operators of SDN technologies. The workshop is expected to: 1) provide an up-to-date understanding of the status and trajectory of SDN development, 2) provide an assessment of the operational goals and gaps of SDN, 3) facilitate discussions of new directions and collaboration opportunities for SDN research and development, 4) provide actionable information for graduate student education and research.</AbstractNarration>
