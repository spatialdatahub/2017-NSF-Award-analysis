<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to deploy ten  temporary seismic stations in the Wellington region on New Zealand's North Island. The recorded seismicity will help constraint the rupture area of the Kaikoura Mw= 7.8 earthquake that occurred in the northern part of New Zealand?s South Island on November 13, 2016. The main motivation for deploying instruments in this region is the potential for earthquakes migrating northwards onto or being triggered on the subduction megathrust located beneath the Wellington area and/or on crustal faults that cut through the region surrounding the capital of New Zealand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stress change calculations show that the area near Wellington has been subjected to an increase in earthquake-causing stress. The plan is to deploy the temporary seismic instruments at sites previously used in the 2009-2011 SAHKE project, concentrating on redeploying in the southwestern part of the former array. This will yield an average station spacing of about 12 km. We will work directly with our collaborators in Victoria University of Wellington on the siting plan, and we will take advantage of their landowner connections for facilitating permitting. We expect to run the stations for about 6 months. Once the instruments are removed and shipped back to the U.S., the data will be converted to a standard archive format and provided to the IRIS Data Management Center, along with the metadata, within one month.</AbstractNarration>
