<AbstractNarration>Flooding along the nation's coastlines can lead to devastating consequences both to life and property as seen in Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy.  Efforts to protect our coastlines from the most dangerous of these events is critical to our sustainable future along our nation's coastlines.  The goal of this project is to provide a means for improving our ability to forecast and predict these events while taking into account key coastal infrastructure that are designed to protect at-risk populations.  This work not only enables direct reduction of loss of life and economic impact via better forecasts however, it also enables the application of mathematics and computation that can start to ask and answer critical questions such as "I want to build a sea-wall, where should I put it and how high should it be?".  The context of these questions is also critical, budgetary constraints and optimal protection are of course central to this effort and this projects aims to enable answering these questions as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops numerical methods that can answer questions related to climate change adaptation strategies addressing coastal flooding due to tsunamis and storm surge.  Both types of events have in the past proven themselves to be immensely destructive and promise to be so in the future. Unfortunately with climate change these events could be made worse, whether due to rising sea-levels or changes to the likelihood of dangerous storms, it is critical to a sustainable existence along the coastlines of the world that we address the threat of coastal flooding.  The work proposed focuses on developing numerical methods that include sub-grid-scale structures that help protect coastal communities with barriers such as sea-walls.  The basis of the work will be the GeoClaw framework, a finite-volume, wave- propagation, and structured- grid code that has previously been validated for both tsunami and storm surge events. GeoClaw addresses some of the multi-scale nature of the coastal flooding problem by using adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and local time stepping but struggles to resolve fine-scale structures without significant penalty due to the resolutions required.  The work proposed focuses on representing barriers at the sub-grid-scale level without the need for fully resolving these structures. This will be accomplished by the development of a new Riemann solver that will be able to represent zero-width barriers at grid cell edges.  This capability will then be used in conjunction with h-box and semi-Lagrangian methods allowing the barriers to have flexible parameterizations in terms of placement with respect to the grid. The method will then be tested on realistic cases and be incorporated into a larger optimization framework that is geared towards finding optimal adaptation solutions emphasizing the capabilities of the flexible specification of the barrier.</AbstractNarration>
