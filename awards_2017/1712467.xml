<AbstractNarration>A hands-on lab class is a key and unique element of the introductory physics experience, yet the implementation of effective labs can be both challenging and expensive. A particular problem is that approaches which work extremely well in small classes can be difficult to scale up to large enrollment courses. The goal of this project is to take a powerful and proven approach to labs, the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE), and to combine it with an inexpensive wireless lab system developed at the University of Illinois, Interactive Online Labs (IOLab), to enable an innovative new approach to the lab component of any large introductory physics class. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent pilot studies involving several hundred introductory physics students at the University of Illinois have demonstrated that moving away from the traditional highly structured concept-focused lab to a more unstructured approach that emphasizes experimental design, sense-making, and scientific communication, can actually improve a student's ability to interpret data and to reason scientifically, with no negative impact on conceptual understanding. These results are especially encouraging since the approach used in the pilot studies is inherently scalable and the IOLab system is inexpensive and readily available. The goal of this project is to assess the content and pedagogy that will be developed to provide similar design-based labs for all 3000 students taking introductory physics at the University of Illinois each semester. A key part of this effort will be to develop the tools and training needed to make this new approach accessible to instructors and teaching assistants that have little prior experience.</AbstractNarration>
