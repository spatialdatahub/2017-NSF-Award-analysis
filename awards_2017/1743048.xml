<AbstractNarration>Proposal ECCS 1150071&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RF Micro Electro Mechanical (MEM) resonators, with quality factors (Q)  often exceeding 10,000, have seen several success stories spanning  communication, industrial, and automotive applications. Despite the  maturity of the RF MEMS field, intimate integration with ICs has not  been possible due to complexity and cost of integration and large  disparity between sizes of MEMS devices and integrated circuit (IC)  transistors. The proposed 5-year program exploring multi-GHz MEMS  resonators using electromechanical transduction with IC transistors  will help overcome these obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits:&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental innovation in resonator design using this transduction  will enable scaled, monolithically integrated RF MEMS devices with  performance rivaling their off-chip counterparts at previously  unattainable frequencies. Active transduction mechanisms in MEMS  resonators leveraging IC technology for high transducer efficiency  with high-gain, high-fT transistors will be investigated. Actively  transduced resonators will be implemented in a Single Transistor Radio (STaR) and RF front-end filters. These system demonstrations require  innovation in circuit design to harness the benefits of active  transducers in resonators with entirely new topologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;This research plan is merged cohesively with an education and outreach  objective targeting K-12 and undergraduate students to increase  awareness and understanding of MEMS and Electrical Engineering. Hands-on MEMS demonstrations through local events (e.g. Cambridge  Science Festival and MIT Women's Technology Program) will supplement  web-based demonstrations and tutorials of the MEMS-based radio systems  developed through this program. This work will also serve in the  development of a grad/undergrad MEMS course, introducing fundamentals  of the proposed transducers and MEMS resonators into the curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
