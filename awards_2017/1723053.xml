<AbstractNarration>Title: 2017 Programming Language Implementation Summer School (PLISS) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides student travel and subsistence for the 2017 Programming Language Implementation Summer School (PLISS). This summer school provides an important and valuable educational opportunity for students to study topics related to designs and implementations of programming languages. The award's broader significance and importance include building international community, broadening participation, and enhancing education of US students, including women and underrepresented minorities. The school also provides students exposure to and multiple opportunities to interact with leading-edge research and researchers. By supporting US-based students, the school thus imparts training to the next generation of programming languages, compilers and software engineering researchers in both industry and academia, as well as to future application developers.</AbstractNarration>
