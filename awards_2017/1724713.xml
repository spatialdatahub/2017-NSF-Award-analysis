<AbstractNarration>The project will enhance the ability of archaeologists to conduct synthetic research that will contribute better understandings of how different sorts of societies function and change over long periods of time. General understandings of social processes resulting from this synthetic research can, in turn, contribute to solutions for problems that face societies across the world today. However, such research can only be accomplished if archaeologists archive their datasets so that they can be readily found, accessed, and used by other investigators. Such research also requires that the datasets be thoroughly documented so the meaning of the individual observations can be properly interpreted. Project researchers have determined that the two major impediments to depositing well-documented data are the time it takes to complete the data documentation process and the lack of training in digital data management. The project will make it easier and faster to deposit archaeological data in a digital repository by improving the software that solicits information about the individual data fields during the process of depositing the data. It will also develop online help and training materials concerning the management of digital data. As a result of these efforts, project researchers expect that more data will be deposited for use by other investigators and that the datasets deposited will be better documented and therefore, more usable for synthetic research. The project helps ensure open access to the results of publicly funded research, both to other researchers and to the public at large, and it enables the reproducibility of key knowledge claims to be carefully examined. This project is directly focused on enhancing the nation's infrastructure for research and education and on expanding use of that infrastructure by researchers in academia, industry, and government. By enabling productive reuse of academic and private-sector research data it will enhance partnerships between academia and industry. By expanding and improving access to results of archaeological research, it will increase public engagement in science. Finally, synthetic research that includes archaeology's long-term perspective, will help address fundamental social issues that have the potential to improve well-being of individuals in society in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project efforts will be focused on tDAR (the Digital Archaeological Record), the largest digital repository in the US that is specifically dedicated to providing preservation and access to archaeological data. tDAR already has key infrastructure in place to support open access, reproducible science, and synthetic research; however it seeks to greatly expand the quantity and increase the quality of the data that the repository makes available and preserves. The project will speed up and improve tDAR's dataset documentation process by automatically extracting as much as possible of the needed information from the database, spreadsheet, or other data source being uploaded. It will then verify the inferred documentation with the human researcher. Training current and future generations of archaeologists in sound practices of digital data management will increase the quantity and quality of archaeological data entering digital repositories. The project will develop online tutorials, webinars, and topical, web-based modules directed to diverse archaeological audiences. Project training materials will address the complete data life cycle from creation of the data in the field, through laboratory and quantitative analysis, to publication and archiving.</AbstractNarration>
