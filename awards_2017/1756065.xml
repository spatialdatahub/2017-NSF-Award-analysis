<AbstractNarration>Stress and evaluations of performance are commonplace in domains such as education, yet&lt;br/&gt;surprisingly little research in humans has investigated the effects of stress on cognition. Although&lt;br/&gt;academic success is often attributed to innate ability, how individuals respond to situational factors, such&lt;br/&gt;as stress, may have an even greater influence on cognitive performance. Thus, it is particularly important&lt;br/&gt;to investigate how stress influences the neural processes supporting cognitive performance. Research&lt;br/&gt;suggests that too much stress may cause an increase in distraction and an accompanying shift away from&lt;br/&gt;engagement of the brain's cognitive control network (CCN), which guides attention outwardly toward the&lt;br/&gt;task, toward greater engagement of the default mode network (DMN), which guides attention inwardly. As&lt;br/&gt;cognitive control is often required to maintain high performance, especially on difficult tasks, this shift may&lt;br/&gt;result in a decrease in task performance. The project will investigate how stress affects levels of the stress&lt;br/&gt;hormone cortisol as well as brain activity in the CCN and DMN during the performance of a difficult task&lt;br/&gt;requiring cognitive control. The research is important because it may identify neural mechanisms by which&lt;br/&gt;stress may prevent students from performing to their potential. This information may aid in effectively&lt;br/&gt;developing approaches to minimize the negative impact of stress on cognitive performance. Additionally,&lt;br/&gt;the proposed research will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in scientific research, as&lt;br/&gt;Rutgers-Newark is consistently rated as having the most diverse undergraduate population in the nation.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, through an established program at Rutgers-Newark, local high school students from&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minority groups will assist with the proposed research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project combines physiological measurements of the stress hormone cortisol with functional&lt;br/&gt;magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how psychosocial stress influences cognitive control&lt;br/&gt;processes and task performance. We aim to determine the effects of the Trier Social Stress Test, a known&lt;br/&gt;psychosocial stressor involving social-evaluative threat that reliably elevates cortisol release, on task&lt;br/&gt;performance and brain network engagement during a Go/No-Go task. This task is ideal because it requires&lt;br/&gt;cognitive control and sustained attention, and distraction leads to a suboptimal response. The project&lt;br/&gt;combines levels of analysis to provide links between the cognitive, physiological, and neural effects of&lt;br/&gt;stress. By investigating the relationship between psychosocial stress and the engagement of DMN and&lt;br/&gt;CCN, this research will provide important insights into how factors other than intelligence, such as how a&lt;br/&gt;potentially stressful event is experienced, drive the brain processes that determine cognitive performance&lt;br/&gt;and academic achievement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
