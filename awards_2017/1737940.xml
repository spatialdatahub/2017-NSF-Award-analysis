<AbstractNarration>The Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) workshop is an annual event with the goal of encouraging participation of junior researchers in integer programming and related areas. A primary focus of this workshop is to showcase young researchers; to increase the visibility for accomplished students at an early stage in their career; and to provide an opportunity for graduate students to network with the world's top researchers. This award will provide funds for 10 graduate students to attend the 14th MIP workshop, each of whom will be presenting his or her poster at the workshop. MIP student poster sessions provide students with an opportunity to highlight their ongoing work and network with other researchers from industry and academia. During the workshop, student posters are also judged by a workshop committee and outstanding posters are recognized. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2017 MIP workshop will be held from June 19th to June 22nd, 2017 at the HEC Montréal (École des hautes études commerciales de Montréal) in Québec, Canada. The solicitation for the posters will be sent to a variety of mailing lists, including those that serve underrepresented groups in an effort to broaden participation: INFORMS Computing Society, INFORMS Optimization Society, SIAM, Women in OR/MS (WORMS), and INFORMS Junior Faculty Interest Group. By providing travel funds for graduate students, NSF will help to decrease the cost of attendance to encourage participation of students and will support the engagement of STEM students in emerging research in the field of MIP.</AbstractNarration>
