<AbstractNarration>This grant award provides support for the 2017, 2018, and 2018 Annual Phenomenology (PHENO) Symposia at the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, under the direction of Professor Tao Han.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the Annual Phenomenology (PHENO) Symposia is to present and discuss state-of-the-art results in theoretical and experimental particle physics;  to stimulate new ideas in cutting-edge research and foster collaborations among physicists;  and to encourage the participation of junior physicists and nurture their career development.   In recent years, the annual PHENO conferences have been devoted, in large part, to studying the physics that might emerge from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva, Switzerland, and to the connections between these experimental results and results from other collider- and non-collider-based experiments in both elementary particle physics and astrophysics and cosmology.  Junior physicists are especially encouraged to attend the Pheno Symposia.  Indeed, a characteristic feature of the PHENO Conferences is the significant involvement of junior physicists (graduate students and postdocs) attending from many institutions in the US and abroad.  Physicists from under-represented groups are also specifically recruited and well represented.   As a result, the PHENO Conferences have become nothing less than the largest professional student meetings in high-energy physics in the United States.   As such, this grant serves the national interest by supporting the development of a cutting-edge scientific infrastructure in the United States and the training of junior physicists to take part in the most current research developments.</AbstractNarration>
