<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in a two day conference entitled "An Upper Midwest Commutative Algebra Conference" at the University of Minnesota on September 22-23, 2017. This is one in a series of meetings designed to bring together faculty and students from the Universities of Minnesota and Wisconsin, as well as from nearby collegiate institutions to discuss topics in and around commutative algebra. Besides promoting scientific discovery and dissemination, the conferences seek to build a stronger regional community of researchers and promote the training and education of graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting will consist of six plenary talks by invited speakers from around the country. While a majority of the faculty in commutative algebra at the Universities of Minnesota and Wisconsin are relatively junior, both institutions have broad and deep communities of researchers whose work interacts with commutative algebra, but who primarily work in other fields including algebraic geometry, combinatorics, number theory, applied algebra, representation theory, computational algebra, and more.  Thus this meeting is well positioned to lead to collaborations across different areas of algebra.  Attendees will consist of a mix of professors, postdocs and students from the two hosting institutions plus other nearby institutions.</AbstractNarration>
