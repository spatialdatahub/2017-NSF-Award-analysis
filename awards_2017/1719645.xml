<AbstractNarration>Abstracts are a public record of active and expired awards and are an important source of information on NSF activities. The purpose of the Abstract is to describe the project and justify the expenditure of Federal funds. Abstracts must not contain inappropriate or confidential information, and because they are available to such a wide audience, high standards of quality must be maintained in preparing them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF award abstract has two parts, which should appear in the following order: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Part 1: A nontechnical description of the project, which explains the project's significance and importance. This description also serves as a public justification for NSF funding by articulating how the project serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission: to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; or to secure the national defense. This part of the abstract should describe the fundamental issues the project seeks to address, as well as other potential benefits, such as how the project advances the field, supports education and diversity, or benefits society. This part should be understandable by a broad audience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Part 2: A technical description of the project that states its goals and scope, the methods and approaches to be used, and its potential contribution. In many cases, the technical project description may be a modified version of the project summary that is submitted with the proposal. However, the technical description should reflect any changes in the project's goals made after the review process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon award of a proposal, the Abstract is available in the Award Search application and via FastLane. &lt;br/&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop brings together researchers to discuss current topics and trends in superconductivity of correlated electrons. The Gordon Research Conference series is a world-recognized series of meetings devoted to promoting interactions of scientists and students and enabling vigorous discussions of current topics. This event focuses on supporting junior participants, particularly from under-represented groups, and includes 13 female speakers. Participants are gathering to discuss the new high-quality experimental results on photoemission, X-ray scattering, neutron scattering, resistivity and Hall conductivity, NMR and other experimental techniques, as well as recent progress made by theory.</AbstractNarration>
