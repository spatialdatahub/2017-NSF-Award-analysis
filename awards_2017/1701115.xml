<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating the Wi-Rhythm, a suite of WiFi algorithms for wireless local area networks that uses distributed scheduling to avoid interference between users in dense deployments. It fills the need for higher performing wireless networks in residences, enterprises, and industries relying on internet-of-things (IoT) technologies. The Wi-Rhythm suite of algorithms is important because WiFi routers enabled with them will better serve environments with high-density deployments such as those expected with IoT (e.g. factories), mixed-use networks where high-priority traffic needs to be protected from low-priority traffic (e.g. homes), and public environments where there is likely to be a high-degree of WiFi heterogeneity (e.g. office buildings).   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in software and hardware for Wi-Rhythm enabled wireless routers, software and hardware for Wi-Rhythm enabled clients, performance measurements for Wi-Rhythm operating in different environments, cost analysis, and a list of compatible devices on which Wi-Rhythm could be deployed. The Wi-Rhythm suite of algorithms will allow WiFi networks to operate in a scheduled fashion and tackle a variety of practical challenges including the presence of non-backlogged nodes, partial connectivity, backward compatibility, power-saving related sleeping, and schedule changes. These capabilities provide the following advantages: higher throughput performance, more precision in service, better energy efficiency, and the deployment of arbitrary scheduling algorithms on the fly, when compared to the leading competing solutions such as those offered by Cisco, Juniper, Brocade, and Huawei in this market space.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: design and proof of concept for how Wi-Rhythm can be deployed on off-the-shelf WiFi devices including wireless routers and client devices, and how Wi-Rhythm can be deployed in scenarios with different degrees of adaptability. Specifically, the research will explore and address issues pertaining to design, performance, scalability, cost, presence of legacy nodes, compatibility, and generality. Possible issues with time synchronization, register settings, computational constraints, and memory usage will be addressed. Fine-tuning of the Wi-Rhythm algorithm parameters will be performed, and a hierarchical system architecture to address scalability problems will be developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, personnel involved in this project, including doctoral and master's students, will receive innovation and entrepreneurship experiences through both Georgia Tech classes and the Georgia Tech Venture Lab commercialization process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages the Georgia Tech Venture Lab to help in the process of accelerating the technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.</AbstractNarration>
