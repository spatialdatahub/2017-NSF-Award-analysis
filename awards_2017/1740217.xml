<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for a summer school that will provide an intensive and interactive educational experience to graduate students from the fields of engineering design and systems engineering who are interested in studying designers, design teams, and design organizations. It is specifically intended to provide educational opportunities for students and graduate programs that do not have coursework in these fields. The summer school will bring together students and experts in the use of research techniques such as case study, protocol study, and controlled-experiment study. This will provide students with foundational understanding about how to use these techniques in engineering and systems design research, create a network of peers who are studying these issues, and advance community research standards. It is anticipated that the summer school will have a broad impact in the research community, including other NSF-supported research projects, by advancing training and standards in this area of research. Travel and participation scholarships will serve to ensure a broad participation that maximizes community impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer school will be held May 14-26, 2017, at Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina. Experts from the community will provide instruction and experiential insights in topics that include case study methods, protocol studies, and controlled experiment research. Major activities include mini- lectures, practice-oriented exercises, and student-led research topic discussions. An expert panel will discuss with students future directions for research in the area. Social events scheduled throughout the two weeks will enable students to develop their networking skills. A survey of summer school participants will be conducted to provide information about success and can inform similar efforts on other topic areas within the engineering design and systems engineering research communities.</AbstractNarration>
