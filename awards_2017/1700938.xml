<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of US participants in the "Conference in Harmonic Analysis at the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences (ICMS)" that will be held July 17-21, 2017, in Edinburgh, Scotland. The support is directed at graduate students, psotdocs, and other early-career mathematicians. For additional information see the conference website: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.icms.org.uk/workshops/harmonicanalysis .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is timed to take maximum advantage of recent progress in the field of harmonic analysis and to harness the momentum generated by those major developments (e.g., advances in multilinear inequalities and Fourier restriction theory; the introduction of algebro-geometric methods, such as the "polynomial method" of Dvir, Guth, and others). The list of speakers includes virtually all of the world's most prominent researchers in harmonic analysis. The program allows ample opportunity for junior mathematicians to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
