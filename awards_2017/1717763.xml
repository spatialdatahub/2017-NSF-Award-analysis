<AbstractNarration>Interconnection networks based on dragonfly and fat tree designs are becoming increasingly dominant in high-performance computing facilities and data centers. A key challenge of managing such networks is workload interference. In a multi-user computing environment, interference among applications for shared network resources can cause a vicious cycle of events (workload interference, low productivity, selfish user behavior, and poor scheduling) aggravating each other. This project seeks to tackle the vicious circle of workload interference.&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop a software framework to systematically analyze and mitigate workload interference on dragonfly and fat tree systems. Completion of the project will create novel interference-aware scheduling policies and scalable software tools for interference analysis and reduction on dragonfly and fat tree networks. The resulting data and tools collected from simulations and experiments will be made available to the broad community under an open source license. An integrated education and outreach plan will enhance the Computer Science curriculum, broaden the participation by underrepresented groups, and outreach to the surrounding communities that are predominantly African-American and Latino.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research focuses on three inter-related research thrusts: (1) high-fidelity network simulation to gain insights into network interference among applications, (2) interference aware scheduling to avoid or mitigate network contention among applications, and (3) real-world experiments to quantitatively measure workload interference of representative applications on production systems and assess interference aware scheduling. The resulting IRON will provide an integrated interference analysis and reduction framework for advancing the research of workload interference on massively parallel platforms.  The project website (http://www.cs.iit.edu/~lan/iron.html) provides all the information about the project (publications, software tools, data, etc.). This project repository will be maintained for at least five years after the project completion.</AbstractNarration>
