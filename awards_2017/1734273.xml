<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests for funding to support three students' travel to attend a workshop called "In Whose Best Interest? Exploring the Real, Potential, and Imagined Ethical Concerns in Privacy-Focused Agenda", co-located with the 20th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW 2017) to be held in Portland, OR from Feb 25-Mar 1, 2017.  CSCW is a top-tier social computing conference, and this workshop is part of an ongoing series of CSCW workshops broadly on the topic of "networked privacy", i.e., that privacy is not just an individual concept but one that can be thought about at the levels of dyads, families, groups, organizations, and communities.  Students from a variety of disciplines will participate in the workshop and the conference, giving them an opportunity to interact with senior researchers in their intellectual communities and expose them to a wide range of work in the field.  As such, it fits closely with the goals of NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, both its intellectual merit goals around analyzing privacy as a collective as well as an individual property, and its broader impact goals around growing the privacy and security research community.</AbstractNarration>
