<AbstractNarration>Evolution of genes and genomes is responsible for the immense biological diversity on our planet.&lt;br/&gt;However, despite its central role as the most fundamental property of life, the process of evolution&lt;br/&gt;remains poorly understood, and current models have typically been unable to span the diversity of&lt;br/&gt;scales at which evolution can act. This work addresses this fundamental shortcoming by developing new&lt;br/&gt;models and algorithms that simultaneously account for the most prevalent processes in eukaryotic gene&lt;br/&gt;family evolution: gene duplication, loss, and coalescence. The new computational framework and&lt;br/&gt;methods will enable researchers to systematically interpret data sets, make substantially more reliable&lt;br/&gt;and robust inferences, and improve our understanding of genome evolution. Because these histories&lt;br/&gt;form the basis of many genomic studies, these results will, in turn, benefit many areas of biology.&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the PI is committed to educating the next generation of scientists. As part of this project,&lt;br/&gt;the PI will provide compelling research experiences for a substantial number of undergraduates, develop&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate courses in Data Science, and continue engaging in several college-wide and external&lt;br/&gt;initiatives aimed at broadening participation in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops models and algorithms in the field of phylogenetic reconciliation, which&lt;br/&gt;compares a gene tree with its species tree to infer the evolutionary events that link them. For&lt;br/&gt;eukaryotic organisms, the most popular reconciliation methods allow for gene duplications and gene&lt;br/&gt;losses, which is appropriate only for species sampled at large evolutionary distances, or allow for&lt;br/&gt;coalescences, which is appropriate only for species sampled at close evolutionary distances. That is,&lt;br/&gt;each model provides only a partial view of evolution, limiting their applicability and accuracy. By&lt;br/&gt;bridging these two models, this research will impact how gene family evolution is represented and how&lt;br/&gt;reconciliations are inferred and analyzed. Specifically, this work addresses three key problems in the&lt;br/&gt;field: algorithmic challenges of scaling to large datasets, statistical challenges of distinguishing biological&lt;br/&gt;signal from noise, and modeling challenges of generalizing across genomes. Expected contributions&lt;br/&gt;include novel algorithms and heuristics for the reconciliation problem, methods for resolving&lt;br/&gt;multifurcating trees, and models that can account for multiple samples per species and for species&lt;br/&gt;hybridization. In addition, the joint evolutionary models and inference algorithms developed here may&lt;br/&gt;motivate further unified approaches in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
