<AbstractNarration>The Bio-mediated and Bio-inspired Geotechnics Research Experience for Undergraduates (BBG REU) prepares future scientists and engineers to develop sustainable solutions to make our nation's infrastructure safer, less intrusive and more resilient. The program will invite a total of 48 students to spend 10 weeks at one of four partner research universities (UC Davis, Georgia Tech, Arizona State University and New Mexico State University) to work on a research project while being mentored by graduate students and faculty in microbiology and civil engineering. All BBG REU projects look to nature for inspiration, either using biological processes or principles to create low-impact solutions for society's infrastructure that work in harmony with natural ecosystems. While introducing students to research and the emerging field of biogeotechnics, the program will focus on the intellectual and professional growth of students in the program. Students learn about career and graduate school opportunities, improve their communication skills, and start to develop their professional networks. All involved in the program will embody a culture of inclusion. Program recruitment will focus on students with little opportunity for research at their home institutions and target students from diverse backgrounds and pathways. A goal of the program is that participants' experiences inspire them to consider academic, industry or government careers that focus on the biogeotechnics discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BBG REU program complements the NSF-funded Engineering Research Center (ERC)for Bio-mediated &amp; Bio-inspired Geotechnics (CBBG). Its primary objectives are to: 1) recruit and prepare students from diverse pathways to increase URG representation in geotechnical engineering; 2) increase awareness of graduate school and career opportunities in engineering; 3) develop students technical and professional skills; 4) emphasize the need to consider sustainable solutions to future engineers and scientists; 5) expose participants to bio-mediated and bio-inspired geotechnologies; 6) advance CBBG research from fundamental research stages to implementation in practice; and 7) create inclusive learning and research environments. The BBG REU targets students from diverse backgrounds and pathways, focusing on institutions where students have limited access to research opportunities. Students from underrepresented groups in engineering, including veterans and students with disabilities, are encouraged to apply. Selected students attend the 10-week apprenticeship program at one of four CBBG partner institutions (UC Davis, Georgia Tech, Arizona State University and New Mexico State University). Activities include a local institution and cross-institution orientation, a one-week CBBG immersion experience for professional development training and activities, weekly webinars/trainings, networking sessions, poster presentations, and social events. All BBG REU projects support new and on-going CBBG research projects. CBBG projects seek to understand and harness the scientific processes and principles of natural phenomena to develop more sustainable, safer, less intrusive, more resilient civil infrastructure systems. The CBBG's approach embodies a transformational shift from traditional energy intensive, mechanical methods for engineering the ground to a sustainable, nature-compatible biogeotechnical approach that employs innovative bio-mediated and bio-inspired technologies to meet the demands of modern society. Throughout the REU program, 48 undergraduate students will complete research projects in the transformative area of biologically-focused civil engineering design. Their exposure is posited to inspire students to consider academic, industry or government careers that focus on protecting society's infrastructure, using low-impact solutions that work in harmony with natural ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
