<AbstractNarration>This award will help support early career researchers who will speak and give poster presentations at the first International Conference on CRISPR Technologies, which will be held December 4-6, 2017 in Raleigh, North Carolina.  The format of the meeting is a combination of talks and posters, which will promote scientific exchange in both formal and informal settings.  A panel session will be devoted to the discussion of ethical and safety concerns related to CRISPR-Cas technology.  There will be ample opportunity for sharing the latest research results and for networking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technologies are powerful tools for genome editing in animals, plants, and microorganisms.  This meeting provides a venue for biologists, chemists, engineers and clinicians to discuss CRISPR-Cas genome editing and its applications to human health, biotechnology and agriculture.  The conference has the following overall goals: 1) to facilitate scientific exchange among Genome Engineering (CRISPR) researchers; 2) to have scientific presentations from a diverse group of researchers who study, design and use CRISPR technologies; 3) to promote interactions between clinicians and scientists, and to promote discussions of the applications and implications of CRISPR technologies; 4) to provide a forum for early career scientists to present their research and to network, since they represent the future of the Genome Engineering field.</AbstractNarration>
