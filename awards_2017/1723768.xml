<AbstractNarration>As society becomes more dependent on digital technology, cyber-crime continues to be an increasing threat. There is a growing need to counter cyber-crime through digital forensics investigations. With rapid developments in technology such as cloud computing, the Internet of Things, and mobile computing, it is vital to ensure the proper training of law enforcement personnel and judges in the theory and practice of digital forensics. This project from the University of Alabama at Birmingham aims to develop curricula, educational materials, and courses for training law enforcement and judicial personnel in digital forensics. The courses will serve the following purposes: (1) educate legal professionals on the basics of computer security and forensics terminology, (2) generate knowledge and understanding of technology that can lead to more effective judicial decisions and (3) reduce mistakes associated digital forensics investigations. Educating law enforcement and judicial personnel will improve the understanding and handling of digital forensic evidence in legal cases and investigations. This will lead to significant improvements in investigating and prosecuting cyber-crime, helping build a safer society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will create and evaluate a unique set of educational modules and courses in digital forensics that are optimized for training legal professionals, including judges, prosecutors, and attorneys. The project will design a series of modules/courses on digital forensics and evaluate their effectiveness in educating the actual target demographics. This will be done in partnership with legal entities as well as practitioners and educational experts and instructional designers. Training materials will be designed to be scalable to nationwide law enforcement and judicial professionals, as well as easily adaptable so that it may keep pace with rapidly changing attacks and forensic techniques. The project will also involve undergraduate researchers and students, as well as women and minorities. Additionally, it will also involve students from a newly established BS degree program in Digital Forensics and the NSF SFS program in Computer Forensics at UAB. Course materials developed for this project will be made available to law enforcement and judicial professionals from all over the nation, helping address the nationwide shortage of legal professionals who are skilled in digital forensics.</AbstractNarration>
