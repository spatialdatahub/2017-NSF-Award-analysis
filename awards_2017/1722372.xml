<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable the efficient use of wireless&lt;br/&gt;spectrum. Over the last decade, the world has seen a sharp increase in the number and diversity&lt;br/&gt;of mobile devices. With this surge in mobile devices, access to spectrum has become an&lt;br/&gt;overarching issue impacting the everyday life of citizens. The demand is expected to grow&lt;br/&gt;exponentially in the coming years, with the rapid adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) linking&lt;br/&gt;everything we interact with in daily life. The technology developed under this project will allow&lt;br/&gt;communication devices to listen and broadcast simultaneously, on the same frequency, thus&lt;br/&gt;effectively doubling spectrum utilization by operating in Full Duplex (FD) mode. By improving&lt;br/&gt;spectral efficiency and simplifying frequency planning, the results from this project will enable&lt;br/&gt;newer paradigms for the rapid design, development and deployment of mobile devices. Society&lt;br/&gt;as a whole will benefit from the increased array of applications enabled by robust, spectrally&lt;br/&gt;efficient communication devices. Furthermore, valuable spectrum assets will be released and can&lt;br/&gt;be redirected to create new opportunities for growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate a practical Full-duplex&lt;br/&gt;communication system prototype. The goal of the project is to develop a functional prototype&lt;br/&gt;showing the ability of fast cancellation that enables reliable full duplex operation at transmit&lt;br/&gt;powers suitable for outdoor deployment. While Full Duplex has been shown to be achievable&lt;br/&gt;under static channel conditions, maintaining the desired isolation between transmit and receive&lt;br/&gt;path in a dynamic channel is difficult, mainly due to the high level of reflected power into the&lt;br/&gt;radio system that can limit its performance. By deploying novel and efficient cancellation&lt;br/&gt;methodologies the prototype will be able to track and compensate for moving targets as they&lt;br/&gt;appear in the radiation space of the FD system. Innovative co-designed spatial, analog and digital&lt;br/&gt;approaches will be used to converge on the optimal parameters for cancellation, while ensuring&lt;br/&gt;a rapid response time. All proposed algorithms under this project will be tested on a real-time FD&lt;br/&gt;prototype system, under realistic wireless channel condition, to ensure that practical issues are&lt;br/&gt;accounted for.</AbstractNarration>
