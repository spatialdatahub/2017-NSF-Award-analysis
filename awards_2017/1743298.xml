<AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support for student participation in the 11th Workshop on the "Principles and Applications of Control in Quantum Systems."  This conference covers many of the research topics central to Quantum Information Science. The support of students through this award makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists. Students who graduate with a background in quantum information science acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop on Principles and Applications of Control in Quantum Systems, which this award supports, is scheduled to be held in July 11-17, 2017 in Seattle, WA.  This conference offers an opportunity for students to present their research results and to interact with senior scientists from the United States, and also the broader international community. This conference also offers students an opportunity to learn about quantum information science applications in several fields. Support is provided only for US students (students enrolled in US universities).</AbstractNarration>
