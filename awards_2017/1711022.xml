<AbstractNarration>The University of Maryland has been granted an award to host a workshop entitled "Early Career Geoscience Faculty: Teaching, Research, and Managing Your Career", in July 2017. The goal of this five-day workshop is to provide concrete skills to support faculty in the early years of their teaching and research responsibilities. The participants will learn about discipline-based educational research, share ideas and strategies for teaching, consider successful strategies for maintaining an active research and scholarly practice, discuss life as an early-career faculty member, and leave with materials and tools for managing their career in academia. Influencing faculty at the beginning of their careers can have a career-long impact, as well as a notable, secondary impact on improving Geoscience education and mentoring. The networks that will form at the workshop will serve to alleviate common feelings of overload and isolation expressed by early career faculty. Previous workshops have indicated that faculty benefit from hearing tips from other professors; developing a network of support; and in making strategic research, teaching, and management plans for the first several years of their academic careers. The funds from this award will provide resources to implement the workshop and to support scholarships for participants whose institutions are not able to support their participation. This workshop is offered in partnership with the National Association of Geoscience Teachers (NAGT) On the Cutting Edge program of professional development workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will advocate for best practices in pedagogy for participants. In that vein, the workshop leaders will model effective pedagogical practices during the workshop, for example active learning techniques and incorporating time for reflection. Leaders will engage the participants actively throughout the workshop using a variety of methods including small and large group discussions, short problem-solving tasks, reviewing and/or trying out activities, and scheduled thinking and writing time.</AbstractNarration>
