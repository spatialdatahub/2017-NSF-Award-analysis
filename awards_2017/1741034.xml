<AbstractNarration>The 1st US-Japan Workshop Enabling Global Collaborations in Big Data Research brings together researchers from the United States (U.S.) and Japan to discuss experiences, challenges, and opportunities in international research collaborations. The workshop provides opportunities for participants from both countries to identify mutual research interests that leverage resources and expertise to accelerate advancements in smart and connected communities, cyber-physical systems, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. The workshop includes two tracks to support a broad range of participation: track 1, for participants with prior collaboration experience and significant potential to advance the field; and track 2, for those without prior collaboration experience who may benefit significantly from the diverse training environments afforded by international collaborations. The outcomes of the workshop will be disseminated through a report describing the main strategic areas, key research opportunities, and collaboration scenarios discussed during the workshop, thereby benefiting a broader research community. The workshop is co-located with the 2017 IEEE International Conference on distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS). This engagement builds upon prior National Science Foundation (NSF)-Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The areas of smart and connected communities, cyber-physical systems, artificial intelligence, and machine learning present intellectual challenges of their own, as well as challenges and opportunities at their intersections. Specifically, the challenges and opportunities created by growing data, sensors, cloud and edge computing, and networking at a global scale call for international research collaborations. For example, advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, paired with the development and implementation of large sensor networks (e.g., Array of Things in Chicago and Fujisawa Sustainable Smart Town in Japan) can enable city-scale data to improve efficiency, economic prosperity, and security in our cities and communities. The workshop will focus on research challenges that are beyond the individual reach of each participant, but that become feasible goals with effective collaboration between the two countries. This can be achieved when both sides share similar interests, but with complementary expertise and skills, (e.g., from different but related areas such as the examples mentioned above).</AbstractNarration>
