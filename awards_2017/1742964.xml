<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the identification of industrial users interested in harnessing olfactory receptor-based biosensors for the rapid detection of chemical and biological targets in the environment or complex aqueous systems.  Unambiguous detection of target chemicals in complex samples has the potential to improve water treatment processes, detect chemical threats in the field, and identify environmental pollutants. Precise detection of biologicals in complex samples has the potential to identify biomarkers for disease diagnosis, reveal contaminated food and water supplies, and alert to airborne pathogens in the environment. The large number of solutions that olfactory-receptor-based sensors have the potential to offer speaks to the large potential commercial impact of this technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project leverages the proteins used in odor detection to generate chemical sensors that fluoresce upon chemical detection. To date, this technology has been used to generate biosensors with flouroescent readout to detect chemicals ranging from biofuels and environmental pollutants to pharmaceutical intermediates and perfumes. Among other applications, the sensors are being used to improve the performance of whole cell and enzyme biocatalysts for the improved production of chemicals.  This I-Corps project explores the commercial potential of the innovation to better define the technical requirements of olfactory-based biosensors in commercial applications.</AbstractNarration>
