<AbstractNarration>At the vanguard of instrumental advances, gravitational wave (GW) detections shall drive profound discoveries at nature's extremes, with the potential of radically transforming the very concept of how we think of space, time, and gravity, as they open new doors to study previously hidden cosmic phenomena. The research program of the Columbia Experimental Gravity group (GECo) aims to maximize the science reach of upcoming gravitational wave discoveries and expand multimessenger science with gravitational waves. In particular, GECo will work on studying the cross correlation between LIGO GWs and neutrino detections from the IceCube observatory in the South Pole. Improved detectors are critical for seeing more of the cosmos with higher fidelity while astrophysically informed data analysis enable insight beyond the state of the art of Today. The aLIGO detectors were built to provide insight on elusive cosmic objects from black-holes to neutron-stars.  Therefore GECo's program aims to improve the odds of discovering neutron-star containing binary systems and enhance the value of each discovery via enhanced detector and data analysis performance. In particular, GECo will work on the characterization of the LIGO detector as well as improving and maintaining the timing systems and developing new data analysis algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Direct detections of gravitational waves provide an unprecedented opportunity born of new data to expose cosmic puzzles using multiple astrophysical messengers. At the root of new discoveries, there will be a multifaceted interplay between improved instruments, advanced understanding of the data, and innovative data analysis approaches relying on a comprehensive mesh of cosmic messengers. GECo will focus on the astrophysical, observational and experimental foundations of synergetic multimessenger campaigns, the firm base of new discoveries. GECo will utilize astrophysical as well as data structure priors to enhance the fidelity of the detections and to enable the confident detection of cosmic signals yet undetected. GECo aims to investigate multimessenger information, with special attention to neutrino counterparts and to enhance electromagnetic follow-up capabilities with low-latency coincident neutrino information. Multimessenger approaches have the potential to enhance the number of detectable sources as more distant, and abundant, cosmic events can become accessible. GECo also aims to investigate gravitational wave searches incorporating astrophysical priors on the properties of binary systems that can potentially enhance search sensitivity. GECo aims to contribute to the proper operation of advanced LIGO, to characterize the performance of mission critical detector subsystems, and to prepare in-depth reports to support exceptional gravitational wave candidates.</AbstractNarration>
