<AbstractNarration>This travel award can defray costs for selected US-based students to participate in the Intensive Research Program on Discrete, Combinatorial and Computational Geometry (IRP-DCCG), which will take place April 16 through June 8, 2018 at the Centre de Recerca Matematica, Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain.  This event is a multi-week program of mini-courses and state-of-the-art lectures, in addition to hands-on experience with software and problem-solving designed to stir interest and deepen capability for research in discrete, combinatorial, and computational geometry,  which in turn expands the opportunities for cross-fertilization between areas of research and application. Several European funding sources support lecturers. This award can defray some of the travel costs for two of the many US-based lecturers, in addition to allowing US-based students to take advantage of the event.  It particularly encourages and facilitates the participation of under-represented groups, giving junior researchers an opportunity to engage in the important technical, professional, and international exchanges that are fostered at a multi-week intensive research event.  For information and selection criteria, see http://dccg.upc.edu/events/intensive-research-program-on-dccg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
