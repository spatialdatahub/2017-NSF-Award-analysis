<AbstractNarration>The international conference on Current Trends and Challenges of Numerical Solutions of Partial Differential Equations  will take place at Purdue University July 7-July 9, 2017. The meeting is a forum to promote, enhance, and stimulate international research interactions and collaborations in applied and computational mathematics. The conference provides a great opportunity for young and minority researchers to closely interact with leading experts in a stimulating environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computational Methods, particularly those for solving partial differential equations, have experienced major developments over the past several decades in both algorithmic advances and applications to other fields.  These developments have had profound implications and applications in  science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This conference brings together leading experts who will  survey the current trends and challenges in the numerical methods for solving partial differential equation. This will lead to identification of promising  new ideas and methods that can advance this active field in coming years.</AbstractNarration>
