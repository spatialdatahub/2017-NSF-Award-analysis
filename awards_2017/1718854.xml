<AbstractNarration>With over 2 billion users worldwide and over 2 million applications (apps) each in Google and Apple's digital marketplaces, smartphones have advanced human society into the mobile era.  Despite the far-reaching societal impact of smartphones, the user experience has been severely limited by smartphone battery life. The obvious idea of extending smartphone battery life is to improve the battery technology, which, however, has stagnated in the past 15 years, and battery capacity is generally viewed as nearing the limits of physics. Instead, this project pursues a course of research to significantly extend smartphone battery life by reducing the energy drain of various software running on the smartphone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to tackle a major smartphone battery drain contributor, app energy drain when running in the foreground, with the goal of reducing it by 2x. The proposed research includes major thrusts that will develop the first set of prescriptive energy profiling techniques that will transform energy profiling from a "passive" app development step into a "proactive" process: (a) It will develop the first capability to automatically uncover the causal relationship between parameter configurations and framework/library method invocations, a unique and hard program analysis problem in framework-based mobile  programming; (b) It will develop the first capability to automatically identify an energy-efficient  implementation of similar tasks, a generally intractable problem but attainable for mobile apps by comparing similar apps that are widely available in the huge mobile app marketplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of this project is heightened by smartphones being an important enabler of Internet access for disadvantaged people in both developed and developing countries, and hence being an important tool in overcoming the "digital divide".  Technically, this work will have a far-reaching impact outside of the area of developing energy efficient mobile apps by increasing compiler capabilities for general event-driven computer programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A project repository will be maintained to provide access to code, raw experimental data showcasing the effectiveness of the developed techniques, and processed results and technical publications. The repository will be maintained during the three-year project period and the two years afterwards, to foster research activities by others in this important area.</AbstractNarration>
