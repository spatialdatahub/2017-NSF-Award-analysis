<AbstractNarration>All cells are surrounded by a membrane that keeps undesirable molecules (like toxins) from entering, but allows the passage of nutrients into the cell, and waste products out.  The ability of nature to control the types of molecules that pass through the membrane is central to biological function.  Nature accomplishes this task by embedding proteins with complex chemical structures into the membrane.  These proteins form small channels that allow specific molecules through, but reject others.  While the importance of natural channels in biology is well-appreciated, the design of artificial channels that exhibit the same functionality as their biological analogs is immensely challenging.  In this research project, Professor George Gokel at the University of Missouri-Saint Louis is studying the transport capabilities of relatively simple molecules inserted into lipid membranes.  The ability to create artificial membrane channels that mediate the passage of specific molecules could impact applications ranging from biology and medicine to water purification, problems with significant societal importance.  In addition, this project is providing scientific training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in interdisciplinary science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Controlling insertion into a membrane, manipulating the selectivity and direction of ion and molecule transport, and understanding the organization of the membrane around the channels, present major challenges in supramolecular chemistry.  With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry program in the Division of Chemistry, the Gokel Lab develops a variety of novel structures that penetrate lipid bilayers and selectively transport cations and molecules through the membranes.  This research enhances understanding of membrane penetrating compounds by using a plethora of techniques to interrogate their properties and functional mechanisms.  The long-term goal is to establish fundamental principles for designing synthetic structures that can substitute complex proteins in mediating the passage of specific molecules into specific types of cells.</AbstractNarration>
