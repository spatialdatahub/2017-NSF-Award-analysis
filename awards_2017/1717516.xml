<AbstractNarration>Many important processes in nature and in engineering applications take place along surfaces. Examples include interaction of lipid and protein molecules in cell membranes or the action of a chemical dispersant on the oil-water interface, while helping to clean-up an oil spill. These and other processes are described mathematically with the help of differential equations posed on surfaces. Numerical methods for solving these equations provide tools for scientists to understand better surface phenomena by doing in silico experiments. The present project aims to develop such accurate and reliable numerical methods for the benefit of academic and engineering community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project develops new higher order unfitted finite element methods for partial differential equations (PDEs) posed on evolving   surfaces. The developed numerical approach uses time-independent background meshes. In a weak formulation of a PDE, the method employs traces of standard finite element spaces on reconstructed evolving physical domains.   The resulting methods will be optimally accurate, handle implicitly defined surfaces, allow a surface to undergo topological changes, and extend to surface-bulk coupled problems. The project goals will be met  by constructing a higher order space-time unfitted finite element method and performing a full convergence analysis, extending the method and analysis to coupled surface-bulk transport-diffusion problems, developing a new hybrid method for PDEs on evolving surfaces that uses finite difference approximations of time derivatives, extending the new approach to fluid equations posed on manifolds.</AbstractNarration>
