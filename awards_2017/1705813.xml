<AbstractNarration>The primary objective of this research project is to improve understanding of how pollutants containing nitrogen deposit into water bodies from the atmosphere. This project directly benefits society by addressing water quality and ecosystem health concerns. These water quality concerns include low oxygen levels and acidic conditions that can result in loss of life in aquatic systems.  This research provides a beneficial tool for improving watershed management. The researchers are seeking to confirm that the emission source for these pollutants can be hundreds of miles away from the water body that is affected. This project supports the training of a Ph.D. student and also engages undergraduate chemical engineering students in research and community outreach activities. In addition, undergraduate students participate in undergraduate research experiences and service-learning projects through partnerships with Connecticut state parks and technical high schools. The project engages the community through monitoring activities that take place at several high schools and state parks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An atmospheric chemical transport model coupled with a watershed model will account for source-resolved pollutant transport across multiple components of the watershed system. The researchers are studying deposition estimates to different watersheds and regional linking with a watershed model over the Connecticut River Watershed. A goal of this research project is to transform watershed and ecosystem management by creating an essential source-resolved bridge between two interacting earth systems: the atmosphere and hydrosphere. This research represents a substantial step forward by providing a comprehensive evaluation of impacts to watersheds throughout the country and developing overarching estimates of the impacts of air pollution on soil and water quality. Results of this project provide societal benefits by addressing water quality and ecosystem health concerns. These water quality concerns include hypoxia which negatively impacts fisheries and acidification which can result in loss of life in aquatic systems. This research also provides a beneficial tool for improving watershed management plan development.&lt;br/&gt; </AbstractNarration>
