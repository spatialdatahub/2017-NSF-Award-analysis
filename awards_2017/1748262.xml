<AbstractNarration>This project will support an educational symposium on "Community College and University Partnerships as Catalysts for Promoting Materials Science Education" at the 2017 Materials Research Society Conference. This symposium will be held concurrently with technical sessions and will provide an overview of materials science education as a function of current partnerships among community colleges, secondary schools, universities, professional societies and businesses. The event will also promote discussions among materials scientists and engineers, teachers, faculty and administrators representing secondary and higher education institutions. The symposium will focus on partnership strategies and best practices currently in use to motivate and provide guidance for current and future materials scientists and engineers. Through these discussions, attendees will gain insight into the integration of partnership elements such as funding, human and equipment resources, institutional commitments, teacher and faculty interactions, and development of academic pathways to build student interest. At the conclusion, a closing session will be held to summarize strategies, recommendations and outline a series of meetings to discuss next steps for those who have an interest in moving forward with exploring partnerships.</AbstractNarration>
