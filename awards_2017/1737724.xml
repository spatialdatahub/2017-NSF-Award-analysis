<AbstractNarration>The University of Hawaii's Outreach College will continue management of the 26th and 27th Dissertations Symposium in Chemical Oceanography (DISCO), a conference originally begun in 1978. These symposia provide recently graduated or soon to graduate, PhD level chemical oceanographers with an opportunity to present their dissertation research in front of their peers, and forge professional relationships that will facilitate their future research and academic careers. The meeting will also offer participants the opportunity to interact with their peers in physical oceanography given the Physical Oceanography Dissertation Symposium will run concurrently with DISCO.  Attendees engage in discussions with agency personnel to better understand funding mechanisms, proposal writing strategies, and how to request shiptime. DISCO XXVI and DISCO XXVII will be held in Kona, Hawaii in October 7-11, 2018 and October 4-8, 2020, respectively. Applicants eligible for participation in a given DISCO meeting are those individuals who have received their doctoral degrees in ocean chemistry within one year preceding the symposium or who are certified by the degree-granting institution as graduating within one year after that symposium. An applicant pool will be developed for the meetings following announcement of the symposia to chemical oceanographers at academic institutions and via websites such as GEOTRACES and Ocean Carbon and Biogeochemistry Program. From this pool, agency personnel, as well as the invited speaker will select the invitees. This symposium is jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.  As in previous years, the DISCO Symposia will aid in furthering the professional development of early career chemical oceanographers, both U.S. and international, who will play a critical role in improving our understanding of ocean and earth science processes.</AbstractNarration>
