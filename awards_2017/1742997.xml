<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/ commercial potential of this I-Corps project is wide reaching with potential applications for the naocomposites that range from active anode material for advanced batteries to electronic ink. Advanced batteries for electric vehicles can offer the opportunity to achieve longer range (reduce range anxiety), higher power solutions (for nimble acceleration and handling), increased range of operating temperatures (increased utility in colder climates). Similar improvements will impact portable electronics and power tools.  In all cases, but particularly in military and aerospace applications, low weight and longer lasting portable energy sources are critical, and batteries using materials with these characteristics will support important technological advances in these wide-ranging applications.  The batteries based on these technologies will likely have lower manufacturing cost compared to current technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project further develops and explores the commercialization potential of a carbon and oxygen-based two-dimensional nanocomposite that has novel electronic properties (ranging from semi-conducting to conducting) and morphology (1:1-Carbon:oxygen ratio, layered structure, flexible).  This combination of properties can benefit applications where materials development is critical for future technological advances. In particular, these materials are made from non-toxic, abundant materials with controllable electronic properties and nanocomposite structure. Recent efforts in the lab have focused on scaling up the production quantity of these materials. This supports the idea that determining strategies for manufacturing scale-up can be achieved once the specific required properties, application and required quantities have been identified.</AbstractNarration>
