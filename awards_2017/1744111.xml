<AbstractNarration>The objective of the research is to innovate an embedded computing engine named ?Centaur? to achieve ultra-high power efficiency by adopting the bio-inspired computation model and the advanced memristor technology. &lt;br/&gt;Three constituent elements are included to address the major technical obstacles: (1) The power-efficient hybrid computing system that integrates memristor-based synapse network and crossbar structure, targeting the flexible and intensive data processing, respectively. (2) The robust design methodology for Centaur, including the circuit and algorithm enhancements as well as the necessary EDA flow. (3) The integration of Centaur into modern heterogeneous systems and the prototype demonstration. Creative applications of critical importance to nowadays mobile and embedded systems by taking the full advantages of Centaur, including pattern recognition and video and image processing, will be also explored.&lt;br/&gt;The research can benefit the embedded system community by the revolutions in computing architecture and hardware design for functional variety, power-efficiency, and cost. The results can further benefit the semiconductor and neuromorphic societies at large by stimulating the interaction between the advances in device engineering and computing models. The developed techniques will be transferred to mainstream practices under the close collaborations with several industry partners, and directly impact the future embedded systems. The activities in the collaboration also include the tutorials in the major conferences on the technical aspects of the projects and new course development. The educational plan will enhance the existing standard curricula by integrating new modules on emerging memristor-based computing architecture and the relevant neuromorphic computing model.</AbstractNarration>
