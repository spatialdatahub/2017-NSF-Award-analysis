<AbstractNarration>This proposal from the University of New Mexico (UNM) creates the Lobo Rainforest NSF I-Corps Site to encourage and support entrepreneurs from all disciplines and backgrounds to commercialize their projects, create new start-up businesses, generate licensing agreements and business models, and submit proposals to the I-Corps national program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants.  I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lobo Rainforest I-Corps Site is a partnership between UNM's two innovation and entrepreneurial units, the Innovation Academy (iA) and STC.UNM (STC). The iA provides students with direct experience and real-world skills in entrepreneurship, equipping them with the requisite proficiency to transition their original ideas into the marketplace. iA offers a suite of courses, a scholars project-based program, a minor in innovation, and an entrepreneurial literacy program. STC works with entrepreneurial faculty and students at UNM to explore new inventions, commercialize technologies, protect intellectual property and create start-up companies based on UNM research innovations. iA, STC and their programs and services co-locate at the Lobo Rainforest Building, a new structure with spaces to accelerate commercialization of intellectual capital and generate successful startup companies. NSF I-Corps Site funding leverages these innovation and technology transfer services, physical facilities, expert staff, and business, industry, and community connections and networks to support 117 new student and faculty teams over a five-year period. Teams collaborate with two I-Corps Nodes in the Southwest corridor, further building on local and regional ecosystems for innovation, and connecting with the National Innovation Network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Mexico is a majority-minority state, and UNM is a Hispanic Serving Institution with a strong track record of supporting commercialization of faculty-originated technology, including 139 women inventors. The iA is comprised of over 50% women, over 50% minorities, and over 65% first generation college students. UNM's demographic is unique for a Carnegie R1 doctoral university (61% minority, 41% Hispanic, 56% female), making it an excellent environment for recruiting and broadening participation of women and minorities in entrepreneurial activities. UNM is also implementing an NSF ADVANCE grant, focused on increasing the participation of women faculty, particularly minority women, in STEM leadership positions, complementing the Lobo Rainforest I-Corps Site program. The UNM I-Corps Site will focus on those mechanisms most useful in expanding entrepreneurial opportunities for women and other underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
