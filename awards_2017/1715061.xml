<AbstractNarration>This project will be the first realistic study of an important type of flow onto black holes, of special interest in astrophysics.  These particular flows, which are very hot but not very dense, have mostly been treated using methods whose assumptions are wrong for this particular combination of conditions.  This work will start from first principles to include the important physics at both small and large scales in new numerical calculations.  Junior researchers will learn about cutting edge techniques, which also help to drive the development of computer hardware and software systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accretion flows around nearby supermassive black holes contain hot and diffuse plasmas where the collisional mean free path is larger than the system size and the dissipative effects determine their thermodynamic and observational properties.  Most theoretical models of these accretion flows are based on ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), which is a collisional fluid theory.  However, a number of assumptions in this formulation break down in hot, low luminosity accretion flows around black holes.  This project is a first-principles computational and theoretical study with a focus on energy dissipation, transport, and particle acceleration.  It uses firstly a general relativistic geodesic algorithm designed to integrate both photon and particle geodesics, and optimized for special-purpose architectures such as graphical processing units (GPUs).  Massive scale gyrokinetic simulations will study both particle-level and global-level characteristics of hot, turbulent, collisionless plasmas.  Secondly, a particle-in-cell code will be used for simulations focused on the microphysics of the plasma.  This will study particle acceleration in current sheets in magnetic reconnection regions of the MHD simulations to quantify non-ideal effects and include the results in hydrodynamic and spectral studies of low radiative efficiency accretion flows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One graduate student will be trained and a postdoctoral associate will be supervised in computational, theoretical, and plasma astrophysics.  The study's use of NSF-supported GPU computational resources will help to maintain cutting edge technology development in the United States, and the particle integrator algorithm will be made publicly available.  The researchers will also run an extensive outreach effort, with public talks, popular articles, and documentaries.</AbstractNarration>
