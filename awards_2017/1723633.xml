<AbstractNarration>Proposals from SEA are fundamentally different form others is this panel because SEA does not support any NSF-funded science. Rather the program is a shipboard educational experience that has offered high-quality academic programs to college, high-school, and graduate students, as well as K-12 teachers, for 45 years. The National Science Board recently named SEA the recipient of its 2016 Public Service Award for making a substantial contribution to increasing public understanding of science and engineering. NSF recognizes that many SEA alumni are professionals working and teaching in the marine sciences and related fields and for that reason have allowed for limited support through the Instrumentation Program. The panel considered this when it evaluated the requests and found that all items were adequately justified and important to the operations of SEA. The proposal was rated as Very Good. Nevertheless, in an uncertain budget year and without compelling NSF-funded work to call on, the Program will offer limited support for the proposal. Of the six requests, the Program will recommend the top two priorities. The remaining four should be submitted next year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Program recommends an award of $16,462 for the purchase of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Deionized Lab Water System                        $7,445&lt;br/&gt;2) Two (2) Water Sampling Carousel Frames   $9,017</AbstractNarration>
