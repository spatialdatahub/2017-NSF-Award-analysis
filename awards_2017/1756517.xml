<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT):  2018-2023&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Systematic long-term (greater than a few decades in length) time-series observations of aquatic and terrestrial environments have led to a more comprehensive understanding of the natural ecosystem variability and have enabled an assessment of human impacts on ecosystem dynamics.  Because of their ability to store and transport large amounts of heat and to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the world's oceans play a critical role in modulating environmental conditions for the sustained well-being of both land-based and marine organisms including humans.  Despite their recognized scientific and societal importance, long-term records of key ocean processes are rare.  In 1988, two ocean time-series programs were established: one in the North Atlantic near Bermuda and the other, the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program, near Hawaii.  For the past three decades, teams of scientists based at the University of Hawaii have made critical measurements of the 'state of our sea.'  These long-term observations have established a baseline against which future states can be compared.  The ship-based HOT program complements other diverse ocean observation programs including remote-sensing via satellites, moored buoys, profiling floats, and autonomous underwater vehicles.  All HOT program data are publicly available and are frequently used by researchers and policy makers around the world.  Education, outreach, and training will continue to play prominent roles in the HOT program.  HOT provides a unique teaching and learning platform for high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students and teachers from Hawaii and around the world.  The frequent cruises provide opportunities for students to gain first-hand exposure to ocean research.  In addition, HOT is a community resource that helps to support the efforts of numerous scientists worldwide who rely on the program's infrastructure (ship time, staff, laboratories, equipment) to conduct their own research, education, and outreach activities.  HOT program data are also widely used in classrooms and appear in textbooks on ocean science.  These sustained, interdisciplinary measurements are crucial for the validation of models that seek to predict global environmental change and its impact on society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific mission of HOT is to investigate temporal dynamics in the cycling of carbon (C) and associated bioelements, and to observe the variability of hydrographical and ecological properties, heat fluxes, and circulation of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG), one of the largest biomes on Earth.  The proposed research will rely on shipboard measurements and deployments of in situ arrays conducted on 10 separate 5-day expeditions per annum, observations from a fleet of remotely operated vehicles, near-continuous moored platform measurements, and deep-moored sediment traps.  These diverse modes of observation, in conjunction with the extant HOT database, will document variability in ocean properties and processes over time scales ranging from diel to decadal.  This project maintains the high quality suite of biogeochemical and physical measurements required for the assessment of ocean C and nutrient pools and fluxes, plankton community structure, ecosystem productivity, and inherent optical properties of the water column.  Extending the length of program observations by an additional five years improves the value of the data sets for deciphering how low-frequency natural and anthropogenic signals influence ecosystem structure in the NPSG. The HOT site is one of only a few in the world where sustained air-sea carbon dioxide flux, primary production, export fluxes, upper ocean physical data, and meteorological observations are routinely made.  Such efforts continue to aid on-going modeling efforts required for predicting how future habitat perturbations may influence ecosystem dynamics in the NPSG and are crucial for the validation of models that seek to predict global environmental change and its impact on society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
