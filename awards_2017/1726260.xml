<AbstractNarration>This project will replace Calvin College's aging computational cluster with a newer, more flexible cluster for multidisciplinary research. The new cluster is designed to facilitate six research projects, as well as research training activities at Calvin, including a nascent Data Science program.  The resource will also offer the flexibility to support research activities beyond the local campus, specifically at Macalester, St. Olaf, and Wheaton Colleges.  By enabling new, as well as enhancing existing research and research training activities at Calvin, the cluster is expected to improve the technological capabilities of the United States cyber-workforce by equipping hundreds of students each year with domain-specific high-performance computing skills in computer science, data science, mathematics, statistics, and the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the cluster will enable research in: a thread safe graphics library (TSGL), used to create real-time visualizations of parallel algorithms; an agent-based economic model to evaluate the effects of different policies during transitions from non-renewable to renewable energy sources; new computational chemistry models used to explore the photophysical properties of common coumarins; accuracies of various economic models; 3D routing systems for first-responders and improved 3D sniper-line-of-sight models used by homeland security personnel in emergency situations; and enhancing Sivvu.org, a new web service for ERFA (Equilibrium Restricted Factor Analysis), a popular computational chemistry technique.  In addition, faculty and student research projects at Calvin, Macalester, St Olaf, and Wheaton colleges will also use the new cluster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore the cluster will enable new degree programs in Data Science and Statistics at Calvin. Students in these programs will use the new cluster to store and process large data sets.   Additionally, the cluster will enhance existing courses, such as CS 374, a course in High Performance Computing (HPC) where students will use the cluster to learn to program with MPI, OpenMP, CUDA, and similar HPC tools.</AbstractNarration>
