<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating polymeric materials research into the creation of higher value, higher performance nylons based on renewable raw materials. The development of these materials is important because bio-based nylons with tunable chemical and mechanical properties are highly desired in the automotive and packaging industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in a prototype polyamide material for which the desired properties will be introduced through the use of 3-hexenedioic acid (3HDA), a bio-derived unsaturated diacid monomer. This material has the following unique features: elevated modulus, impact strength, flexibility, increased solvent resistance, and tunable hydrophobicity. These features provide advantages such as a larger window of operation and access to new properties when compared to the leading polyamides in the market place. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technological gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The chemistry of 3HDA when embedded in a polymeric structure needs to be further studied in order to identify and implement efficient cross-linking and derivatization techniques. In addition, variables such as 3HDA concentration, nature of the cross-linker or derivatization agent, and polymerization and curing conditions need to be investigated. The impact of these variables on average molecular weight, polydispersity, melting temperature, and mechanical properties needs to be understood to achieve the level of control expected for performance plastics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, personnel involved in this project, including one graduate student and one postdoctoral researcher, will receive innovation and technology translation experiences through developing a functional prototype that meets the needs of potential customers and catalyzes discussions with potential industrial partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships and the Division of Engineering Education and Centers; reflecting the alignment of this project with the respective goals of the two divisions and their programs.</AbstractNarration>
