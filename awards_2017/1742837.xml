<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for meetings of the Lehigh-Harvard Conference on Geometry and Topology, to be held during 2017-2018 at Harvard University (2017) and Lehigh University (2018). The main purpose of the conference is to bring leading researchers of national and international stature in geometry and topology to present their latest work, to discuss the forefront of these fields, and to interact with other mathematicians from the region and around the country. In this way, it provides a great platform to promote research and advance knowledge in the fields of geometry and topology. The Lehigh-Harvard conference also makes it possible for the community of geometers and topologists from the region and around the country to learn the most recent developments, to meet with each other and to share mathematics. Through the participation of the conference, graduate students, post-doctoral scholars and members of under-represented groups are exposed to exciting research in geometry and topology and have the chance to interact with experts in the fields. When the conference is held at Lehigh, in addition to invited talks, considerable time is set aside for 40-minute contributed talks (in parallel sessions) by the participants, and a large percentage of such talks in the past have been presented by graduate students, postdocs and women mathematicians. The invited speakers and other senior researchers also attend these contributed talks, and they provide excellent feedback to the speakers, especially for junior faculty and graduate students. In this way, the Lehigh conference provides an excellent opportunity for graduate students and recent PhDs to present their own research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2017 Conference on Geometry and Topology will take place at Harvard University from April 28 to May 2, 2017. It will feature a total of 33 invited talks by leading experts in many diverse areas of geometry, topology, and related fields: differential and symplectic geometry, algebraic and complex geometry, geometric analysis and geometric flows, geometric topology, mathematical physics, theoretical physics, etc. The conference will highlight some of the most exciting progress in geometry and topology in recent years. The scope and the large number of distinguished speakers makes this conference unique. Participation is open, and there is no registration fee. Graduate students, recent PhDs, and members from underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support.  The 2018 Lehigh Geometry and Topology Conference will concentrate on geometric flows. More specifically, the 3-4 day conference, in June of 2018, will invite 6 to 8 top experts to give plenary lectures which will survey recent significant developments in the field of geometric flows. In addition to contributed talks by participants in geometric flows, there will also be background lectures for graduate students and recent PhDs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information about the Lehigh-Harvard Conference on Geometry and Topology can be found at the following websites:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.harvard.edu/jdg/&lt;br/&gt;http://www.lehigh.edu/~dlj0/geotop.html</AbstractNarration>
