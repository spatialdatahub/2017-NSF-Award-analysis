<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation by members of the Engineering community in the 2017 Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) Workshop on Emerging Frontiers in Engineering on June 7, 2017 in Ithaca, New York. This workshop aims to bring together internationally recognized experts as well as promising young scientists interested in exploring new techniques being developed for the engineering sciences to better exploit next-generation high energy synchrotron x-ray sources.  This workshop supported by this award will be held adjacent to the 2017 CHESS Users' Meeting, in parallel with a workshop exploring "CHESS Workshop on Emerging Frontiers in Biology," and adjacent to the annual meeting of the Interdisciplinary Consortium for Research and Educational Access in Science and Engineering (INCREASE), an organization that promotes research and education at minority-serving institutions. The format of the workshop has been designed to maximize interaction among attendees through presentations, poster sessions, extended question and answer sessions, and networking activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2017 Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) Workshop on Emerging Frontiers  aims to identify the most compelling and significant challenges in engineering today, and do so with an audience that combines instrument builders at synchrotron facilities and members of the engineering modeling community that can benefit from these new data. The attendees will explore "what if" scenarios, and how the on-going development of upgraded x-ray beamlines at CHESS could provide better, new and/or unique facilities to the engineering community.</AbstractNarration>
