<AbstractNarration>This project will address the immediate challenge of providing undergraduate research experiences for all students pursuing an undergraduate science degree with teacher certification at the secondary level, commonly referred to as preservice science teachers (PSTs). A well-prepared STEM workforce is essential to the Nation's health and economy and preparing this scientifically literate population starts with producing teachers with strong knowledge of content and instructional strategies. The goal of this project is to improve STEM learning and learning environments for undergraduate college students preparing to become science teachers. This project will provide PSTs with multiple opportunities to conduct scientific research during their science methods courses. These new or modified science methods courses will be designed to enhance PSTs' skills in conducting research and teaching others to conduct scientific research. These research skills will empower PSTs to improve their future students' scientific and analytic skills.  Additionally, PSTs will be better equipped to develop standards-based inquiry science lessons that will in turn, better prepare their students to enter post-secondary education and a globally competitive workforce. This project will advance knowledge in how to better prepare PSTs to teach middle/high school science. It will also provide data on how research experiences contribute to teacher development and determine the transferability of the TSTR model to other teacher preparation institutions. This is an Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) project - Engaged Student Learning track, Development and Implementation project under the Division of Undergraduate Education, and is supported by both IUSE and Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship funds.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An expectation for science teachers is for them to produce a scientifically literate populace, knowledgeable in science content, the methods/practices of science, and the nature of science. The project's fundamental premise is that by learning the nature of science through authentic research experiences, PSTs will strengthen their science literacy skills and be better equipped to engage their future students in the science and engineering practices identified in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The core of this Transitioning Students to Teacher-Researchers (TSTR) model encompassed in this project is the evidence-based, instructional practice of providing students with Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs). This project will adapt this practice for PSTs by transforming the science methods curriculum to include two Science Methods courses - Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (SM-CUREs), with an optional Science Methods-Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SM-SURE), followed by Science Methods-Course-Based Undergraduate Teaching Experiences (SM-CUTEs). Multiple forms of assessment (surveys, lesson plans, reflective writings, observations, and interviews) will be used to determine changes in PSTs' research skills, pedagogical content knowledge, and understanding about the nature of science. The TSTR model provides PSTs with extensive mentoring by faculty and graduate students from multiple science and engineering disciplines and colleges across the university. To strengthen the quality of mentoring, this project will provide research mentors with professional development designed to deepen mentors' understanding of the K-12 science classroom and skills in transitioning their STEM research to that environment. Knowledge gained from this project will further our understanding of the role that participation in scientific research plays in developing teachers' proficiency in teaching the science and engineering practices outlined in NGSS.</AbstractNarration>
