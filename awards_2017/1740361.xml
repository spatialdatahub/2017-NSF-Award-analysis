<AbstractNarration>This award is cofunded by the Office of International Science and Engineering. This project aims to support the participation of U.S. researchers, postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students in one of the first Pan American Nanotechnology Conference to be held from November 27th to 30th at Guaruja, Brazil. Preference for allocation of travel support will be given to underrepresented groups in USA, i.e. minorities, females and researchers/students with disabilities as well as early career scientists. This conference will provide a venue for understanding nanotechnology and nanoparticles behavior in biological, chemical and environmental systems with the purpose to develop useful and sustainable applications throughout the Pan-American region. In this conference, educational, regulatory, social and economic aspects of sustainable nanotechnology applications will be also discussed. This conference will be the largest assemblage of participants from the Americas sharing knowledge and fostering collaboration to move forward the development and application of sustainable nanotechnologies and nanomanufacturing with the final aim to solve societal challenges as well as protect and improve the environment and human health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will have plenary and concurrent smaller breakout sessions to introduce different areas of the nanotechnology field, including: biological-nano interactions, chemical-nano interactions, ecological-nano interactions, sustainable nanomanufacturing, nanoinformatics and modeling, as well as educational, social, economic and legal aspects of nanomaterials and nanotechnologies. This conference will be one of the first assemblage of participants from the Americas sharing knowledge and fostering collaboration with the purpose of moving forward the development and application of sustainable nanotechnologies to improve quality of life worldwide while promoting protection of the environment and human health.</AbstractNarration>
