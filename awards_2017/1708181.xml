<AbstractNarration>Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of normal atoms, but must be otherwise undetected elementary "dark matter" particles that do not emit or absorb light. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. A leading hypothesis is that it is comprised of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, that were produced moments after the Big Bang. If WIMPs are the dark matter, then their presence in our galaxy may be detectable via scattering from atomic nuclei in detectors located deep underground to help reject backgrounds due to cosmic rays. Direct detection of WIMP dark matter would solve a fundamental mystery in particle physics and cosmology, providing a unique window to learning about the primary matter constituent of the Universe and of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. This award will support students and scientists working on the SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment that aims to achieve world-leading sensitivity for dark matter searches in the 1-10 GeV/c2 mass range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of the SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment extends beyond the search for dark matter. The CU Denver group prepares undergraduates for graduate education or careers in technical fields through their integral involvement in all R&amp;D activities. Undergraduate students, working closely with the PI, will study the sensitivity of the SuperCDMS SNOLAB SQUIDs to ambient magnetic fields and the associated degradation of sensitivity (increased noise levels) when operated in a lightly-shielded magnetic environment. The PI participates in outreach activities with two local magnet schools.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The experiment will be located at SNOLAB, in Ontario, Canada, the deepest underground laboratory in North America. This support will primarily allow the PI and his students to conduct the specific responsibilities this group has agreed to undertake within the collaboration. Among the collaboration responsibilities, CU Denver serves as the primary facility for post-fabrication SQUID verification of all devices to be used in SuperCDMS SNOLAB and test facilities, and is heavily involved in design of and measurements on the readout electronics. The CU Denver group will participate in the pre-operation and commissioning activities for SuperCDMS SNOLAB, specifically integration of the tower electronics, the readout electronics, and the DAQ, and installation and commissioning of the experiment at SNOLAB.</AbstractNarration>
