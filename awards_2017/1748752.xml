<AbstractNarration>Fluorine-containing chemicals are contaminants of emerging concern because of their toxicological properties, widespread presence in manufactured goods, and incredible stability in the environment.  These compounds are used in many industrial processes and are found in a wide range of consumer products. This project aims to use innocuous, chemical-sequestering compounds, called cyclodextrins, for the remediation of legacy and emerging fluorine-containing chemicals.  This research project also seeks to gain a fundamental understanding of how cyclodextrins sequester fluorine-containing chemicals in the environment and then to develop a cyclodextrin-based treatment technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objective of this research project is to explore the combination of environmentally friendly beta-cyclodextrins for the remediation of legacy and emerging per- and polyfluoro alkyl substances. While the project researchers have demonstrated enhanced removal of perfluorinated octanoic acids using cyclodextrin in combination with activated carbon, there is a lack in the fundamental understanding about the cyclodextrin complexation of per- and polyfluoro alkyl substances and how the cyclodextrin:per- and polyfluoro alkyl substance complex properties may be exploited for contaminant remediation.  Guided by strong preliminary evidence the project researchers are pursuing two specific objectives: 1) determining binding constants for and detailed characterization of amino cyclodextrin:per- and polyfluoro alkyl substance complexes, and 2) employing combinations of beta-cyclodextrins and carbon-based materials for remediation of per- and polyfluoro alkyl substances.  The project is expected to provide information critical for the development of sustainable strategies for per- and polyfluoro alkyl substances removal from water. The research activities are promoting teaching, training and learning by bringing together a research team composed of undergraduate students, graduate students, and researchers from two institutions in different states. Results are being broadly disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at scientific meetings. Special presentations, seminars and web seminar series are being organized to enhance public awareness on health risks of per- and polyfluoro alkyl substances and on cost-effective methodologies to address this serious environmental problem.</AbstractNarration>
