<AbstractNarration>Model predictive control is widely being implemented in many industries, such as chemical plants and oil refineries, leading to substantial improvement in operations.  The use of process monitoring through model-based sensors has enabled industries to predict and improve processes. Prior research has introduced novel safety systems using models, which generate alarm signals that can provide warnings of pending problems. This research project involves developing a process improvement model will not only prove useful for the chemical and petrochemical industries, but will also benefit the food, nuclear, aircraft, and petroleum industries by identifying potential hazards. Deployment of this model would result in saving lives, reducing workplace injuries, and economic benefits. The researchers are collaborating with theÂ Air Liquide Corporation, which will ensure the industrial relevance and practicality of the results of this research and will enhance the dissemination of research results. The data resulting from this research project will also provide improved security of industrial operations. Additionally, the researchers are developing educational modules and projects based on the outcomes of this research for use in graduate and undergraduate engineering courses at Drexel University and the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this research project are to study: (1) robust large-scale state-estimate prediction (robust to process-model mismatch and unmeasured inputs), (2) offline optimization-based calculation of the worst-case combinations of process-model parameter values and the most extreme control actions, (3) efficient implementation of the model-predictive safety system for large-scale plants, and (4) implementation and testing of the model-predictive safety system first on the steam-drum system of an integrated steam-methane reformer/pressure-swing adsorber unit through simulations, and then on a steam-drum system in a real integrated steam-methane reformer/pressure-swing adsorber system in real time at Air Liquide. The research team also is developing industrial guidelines for adding and maintaining model-predictive safety systems as a complement for existing functional (safety-instrumented) systems. The involvement of the industrial collaborator enriches the training of graduate and undergraduate students involved in the project.  The research project also is being integrated with the Drexel Co-op Program, and undergraduate students, preferably from underrepresented groups, are being recruited for six-month long research internships.</AbstractNarration>
