<AbstractNarration>Many computing infrastructures on which we depend rely on the platforms being secure and trustworthy. Hardware is at the most fundamental abstraction level on which software runs. Trusted hardware platforms comprise the backbone for successful deployment and operation of these infrastructures. Research in recent years shows that as tampering and reverse engineering mature in their sophistication, the challenges in guaranteeing the trust and security of these components also grow. The International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST) aims to continue its role as a premiere forum that invites novel solutions to address these challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Security attacks are growing in sophistication, and increasingly target hardware. Backdoors inserted into electronic designs can allow for silent intrusion into the system. Furthermore, new forms of attacks that exploit side-channel signals are being developed. In addition, intellectual-property (IP) protection is becoming a major concern in the globalized, horizontal semiconductor business model. The intellectual merit of this proposed activity includes professional development for undergraduate and graduate students as well as continued growth of the symposium. Preparation has begun for HOST 2017 to be held in the Washington, DC Metro Area. This project provides opportunities for 36 students to receive travel support (i.e., registration, transportation, and lodging) to attend HOST 2017. Their attendance enables them to learn about the latest tools, design methods, architectures, circuits, and novel applications of secure hardware. Technical contributions from previous symposia have covered topics such as: (1) counterfeit detection and avoidance, (2) side channel analysis and fault analysis, (3) hardware architectures for cryptography, and (4) physically unclonable functions (PUFs). The travel grants would encourage more students to consider a technical submission, participation in hardware demonstration to a large diverse audience, or even to attend as a means to prepare for a technical submission in future years.</AbstractNarration>
