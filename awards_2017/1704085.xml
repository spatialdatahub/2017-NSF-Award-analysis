<AbstractNarration>This project will develop a multiwavelength surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) method for determining genomic mutations within specific genes related to antimicrobial resistance. The PI has published convincing preliminary results on extracting relevant information related to the composition of DNA strands from the measured SERS spectra. The ability to rapidly determining the genomic mutations within specific genes related to antimicrobial resistance would have a significant societal impact.mThe project will provide scientific training for students at graduate and undergraduate levels across several multidisciplinary fields, exposing them to advanced photonics, nanoscale fabrication, surface chemistry, and medical diagnostics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop the chemical resonance excitation wavelength selection (CREWS) method for determining genomic mutations within specific genes related to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The proposed platform employs multiple excitation wavelengths to maximize the amount of data acquired from DNA using Raman spectroscopy, and uses advanced signal processing techniques to identify mutations within genes responsible for causing AMR. This technique provides an alternative approach to genomic mutation detection without the need for DNA sequencing, in which quick and efficient label-free detection of single point mutations in DNA strands can be performed.</AbstractNarration>
