<AbstractNarration>The AITSE project, an NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilot, will address broadening participation challenges specifically related to engaging American Indians in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines. Many Native students decide not to pursue STEM degrees because of their low proficiency in math and science, perpetuating their underrepresentation in STEM fields and hindering technological advancements in their communities. This pilot effort will develop an innovative strategy that integrates the talents and resources of a diverse set of partners, after-school hands-on and Indigenous-based learning/research opportunities, and long-term programming to create a transformative experience to increase Native engagement in the STEM enterprise. The AITSE Network pilot project partners will include, but are not limited to, programs affiliated with a state university, Tribal colleges, Tribal education partners, and regional middle schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use the collective impact framework to unite a network of partners to improve STEM engagement for Indigenous youth and their communities. The pilot focuses initially on one reservation in Montana and will expand to seven additional reservations to achieve the following project goals: (1) develop a network of cross-sector partners to collectively impact STEM education in Native populations; (2) increase the competency and positively influence the attitude of Native students in math and science, with a preliminary focus on middle school, through experiential and community-based learning that is culturally relevant, and (3) build community awareness and investment in STEM in Native communities and within Native leadership and governance.  The expansion of this pilot project will further develop and reinforce this network to support the success and inclusion of these students through post-secondary study in a STEM discipline, as well as translate a coordinated STEM education pathway model that is infused with indigenous content to Native communities nationwide.</AbstractNarration>
