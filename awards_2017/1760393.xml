<AbstractNarration>Unusual Oxidation and Domino Reactions via Palladium-catalyzed alpha-Heteroarylation of Ketones&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The preparation of organic chemicals using palladium catalysts continues to grow in importance in both fundamental research and industry. Reactions catalyzed by palladium are extremely useful and used in many different fields of chemistry such as basic chemicals, dyes, organic light emitting diodes, crop protection chemicals, and pharmaceutical agents. To further improve and expand these catalytic reactions, it is imperative to develop a fundamental understanding of the underlying chemistry in order to discover new chemical transformations, produce fewer byproducts, and generate less waste. In this project, Dr. Lili Ma is investigating two types of palladium-catalysis, oxidations and domino (sequential reaction steps) reactions. Spectroscopic techniques are being used to understand the fundamental steps of these reactions, and their applications in green chemistry, ligand design, biochemistry, and medicinal chemistry are also being explored. Dr. Ma is actively engaged in STEM research activities such as an international summer research intern program and UR-STEM summer research program for students without previous research experience. Dr. Ma is also highly involved in STEM outreach activities such as the STEM day for grade school students, STEM expo day, and the Saturday Program for Access to Rewarding Knowledge (SPARK) to improve the education for grade school and high school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Lili Ma of Northern Kentucky University is developing palladium catalysts for unusual oxidation reactions and domino reactions via direct รก-heteroarylation of ketones. The first reaction under investigation is a Pd-catalyzed, microwave-assisted synthesis of 1,2-diketones. The 1,2-diketone products are applied to the synthesis of versatile building blocks which include heterocyclic rings, diamines and diimines. The second reaction under investigation is a Pd-catalyzed microwave-assisted, one-pot domino approach for the synthesis of heteroaryl isocoumarin derivatives. These efficient organic reactions provide convenient access to building blocks which are useful for applications ranging from materials chemistry to medicinal chemistry. Studies of the catalytic cycle are being probed using 1H and 31P NMR techniques to gain insights on the reaction mechanisms. Dr. Ma is an active participant in the STEM research and outreach programs. In support of the broader impacts of the project, her research activities in conjunction with the department and university STEM programs provide opportunities to recruit and retain female students, first-generation college students and African American/Latino research students in the STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
