<AbstractNarration>The National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS) will host its ninth annual Undergraduate Research Conference (URC) at the Interface of Mathematics and Biology, Nov. 10-11, 2017, in Knoxville, Tennessee. Since 2009, the conference has showcased the wide array of undergraduate research in mathematical biology, has provided students a chance to practice their scientific presentation skills in front of a supportive audience of peers, and has given students a venue to network with others having similar interests. In addition, two invited lectures by inspiring leaders in research at the interface of mathematics and biology will teach students about current research in this area. About 100 participants will attend the conference, many from traditionally under-represented groups in mathematics and biology. Since the conference emphasizes networking and reaching as many students as possible,  the conference format allows the possibility of all student participants to have the valuable experience of presenting their choice of a research talk or poster to peers. The event strengthens exchanges between the mathematical sciences and life science disciplines, as many of the projects are presented by student teams of math and life science majors. It is not uncommon to hear from life science students attending the conference that their eyes have been further opened to the usefulness of mathematics for making exciting progress in biological questions, and for mathematics students to be inspired by encountering new applications for their mathematical tools of which they were previously unaware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NIMBioS URC's primary objective is to provide opportunities for undergraduates from across the country to share their research at the interface of biology and mathematics to peers and faculty mentors. Between 50 and 70 contributed student talks and posters will be featured. Student abstracts will be gathered into a program book and published on the NIMBioS conference website. Students present their own work that uses mathematical, statistical and computational approaches to address challenging questions in the life sciences in areas of molecular biology, biochemistry, epidemiology, immunology, ecology, and more. Participants' work comes from summer or academic year research experiences supported by agencies such as the NSF, the National Institutes of Health, the National Security Administration or through their home institutions, allowing for excellent cross-pollination of ideas from different programs. These young researchers will receive helpful feedback and have their eyes opened to the variety of applications for mathematical tools in biology as well as the opportunities biological problems provide for exciting advances in mathematics. Sharing information about recent research and forming new connections may result in significant progress in undergraduate mathematical biology research programs, enriching the research programs of faculty mentors. The conference's secondary goals are to provide students with career and graduate school information and opportunities to network. Each conference hosts a panel discussion on career opportunities, a graduate school showcase, and ample networking opportunities through shared meals, frequent breaks, and an organized networking game. The conference provides a valuable opportunity for students to develop their identities as researchers, and the interest in this conference has continued as there are many more qualified applicants applying for travel support each year than there are funds available.</AbstractNarration>
